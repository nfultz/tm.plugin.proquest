ate Friday by acquiring a failed San Diego financial institution immediatel=

 all $250 million of deposits of the local customers of 1st Pacific Bank of=
 California.</p>              <p>1st Pacific's six branches will reopen Mon=

tened as City National Bank offices in the next few months, said City Natio=

   </head>            <body>              <p>Every time I hear a big indust=
ry crab about how some new set of government regulations will mean the end =
to life as we know it, bring the economy crashing down around our heads, or=
 burden the consumer with more passed-on costs, I think of the smartest wor=
ds Ronald Reagan ever spoke.</p>              <p>They were &quot;There you =
go again.&quot;</p>              <p>Reagan and I wouldn't have seen eye to =
eye on much, but this phrase sums up my exact reaction to the arguments by =
the financial industry and its chums in Washington against the financial re=
gulation bill now before Congress.</p>              <p>It's not just that t=
hey're opposed to any new initiatives -- that's just industry doing what co=
mes naturally. It's the dismal sameness of the arguments, decade after deca=
de, that gets to me.</p>              <p>The bankers' brief against regulat=
ion today is that the reforms will stifle economic recovery, hamper sound i=
nvestment, create an uncontrollable government bureaucracy, and overburden =
small businesses. They also said that the government regulations were unnec=
essary because business was perfectly capable of regulating itself.</p>    =
          <p>They made exactly the same arguments in 1933 and 1934, when Co=
ngress enacted a historic round of banking, securities and stock exchange r=
eforms.</p>              <p>Let's compare remarks made April 29 by Sen. Ric=
hard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), an opponent of the latest reform proposal, with st=
atements in 1934 by Richard Whitney, then the president of the New York Sto=
ck Exchange.</p>              <p>Shelby: &quot;We are still left with a bil=
l this afternoon that will create massive and intrusive new government bure=
aucracies....&quot;</p>              <p>Whitney (letter to the presidents o=
f all listed corporations, Feb. 14, 1934): &quot;The ... commission might d=
ominate and actually control the management of each listed corporation.&quo=
t;</p>              <p>Shelby: &quot;... reduce private investment in produ=
ctive projects, make risk management more difficult, and threaten our econo=
my....&quot;</p>              <p>Whitney: (letter to President Franklin D. =
Roosevelt, April 12, 1934): &quot;The immediate and necessary effect of ...=
 enactment will be a renewed deflation of security prices and a dislocation=
 of business which will unquestionably interfere with your program for reco=
very.&quot;</p>              <p>The commission Whitney named was the Federa=
l Trade Commission, which was eventually replaced in the bill by a new Secu=
rities and Exchange Commission.</p>              <p>But he didn't like the =
new commission any more than the old, nor did he relish the public reports =
that under the bill would have to be made by corporations, their top office=
rs and major shareholders. These included &quot;elaborate financial and oth=
er statements ... many of which must be certified by independent certified =
public accountants,&quot; he warned.</p>              <p>The rules and regu=
lations protested by Whitney did go into effect, of course, after enactment=
 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>              <p>Did they hampe=
r capital formation, reduce the liquidity of the stock exchange and stifle =
recovery, as Whitney predicted? On the contrary, the rules helped give inve=
stors the confidence in the capital markets necessary for this nation's rec=
overy in the postwar period and its majestic economic growth for decades to=
 come.</p>              <p>In 1933, Wall Street's name was mud. The Senate'=
s investigation of stock exchange practices under the dauntless Ferdinand P=
ecora exposed the black bag of lies and chicanery that had stolen the life =
savings of millions of Americans. Without the reforms of 1933 and 1934, the=
 markets' credibility might never have recovered.</p>              <p>But t=
he way of the world is for regulated industries to go to the mat against ne=
w initiatives, no matter how prudent and sensible they might be. Almost alw=
ays they prove to be positives for the industry, not disasters.</p>        =
      <p>In June 1933, the American Bankers Assn. urged its members to &quo=
t;fight ... to the last ditch&quot; an &quot;unsound, unscientific, unjust =
and dangerous&quot; proposal then making its way through Congress.</p>     =
         <p>The target? Federal deposit insurance.</p>              <p>The =
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. was created over their objections (and, it =
should be said, the opposition of Roosevelt). What happened? Deposit insura=
nce &quot;succeeded in achieving what had been a major objective of banking=
 reform for at least a century, namely the prevention of banking panics.&qu=
ot;</p>              <p>These words come from the economist least likely to=
 deliver knee-jerk praise for the New Deal, Milton Friedman. As Friedman ob=
served in his landmark &quot;A Monetary History of the United States&quot; =
(written with Anna Schwartz), in 1933 there were 4,000 bank failures. In 19=
34, among insured banks there were nine. After that, except for the savings=
 and loan crisis and deregulatory years of the 1980s and early '90s, the ba=
nk failures in almost every year can be counted in single digits -- even in=
 the disaster year of 2009, the number of banks failed or assisted by the F=
DIC was a surprisingly modest 148.</p>              <p>It's not just Wall S=
treet. In the 1970s, the auto industry groused that Washington's taste for =
safety regulations was setting up Detroit to get eaten alive by the Japanes=
e. Today, automakers fall over each other to enumerate their cars' safety f=
eatures, which turned out to be something American consumers appreciate.</p=
>              <p>One common tactic of industries facing new regulations is=
 to try to derail them by pledging to police themselves. Whitney in 1933 tr=
aveled to Washington with a portfolio of self-regulatory initiatives he hop=
ed would head off the exchange control bill. Congress rightly recognized th=
at as a promise to deliver the investing public's interests &quot;into the =
hands of the representatives ... who officiated in the looting of these peo=
ple.&quot; (The words are the New Republic's.)</p>              <p>Today th=
e Washington lobbyists for the international derivatives industry assure us=
 that the purveyors of these monstrously complicated financial wagers, whic=
h contributed to the downfall of major Wall Street institutions and the mor=
tgage market itself, are working &quot;proactively&quot; to change their ma=
rkets &quot;for the better.&quot;</p>              <p>Should Congress go al=
ong or pursue derivatives regulation of its own? Perhaps the answer can be =
found in the testimony of Thomas G. Corcoran, a drafter of the 1934 securit=
ies act, who was asked at a Senate hearing to identify the &quot;chief sinn=
er&quot; in the manipulations that the New York Stock Exchange had allowed =
to take place under its nose for years.</p>              <p>&quot;It is har=
d to tell who is the chief sinner, sir,&quot; he replied. &quot;There are s=
o many sinners.&quot;</p>              <p>--</p>              <p>Michael Hi=

            <body>              <p>Illinois Bankers Association Chief Execu=
tive Linda  Koch recently gave a piece of her mind to Ben Bernanke and Shei=
la Bair.</p>              <p>Illinois bankers are &quot;deeply concerned&qu=
ot; about &quot;overly conservative&quot; financial examiners, the trade gr=
oup chief said in a letter to the leaders of the Federal Reserve and the Fe=
deral Deposit Insurance Corp., as well as other regulators.</p>            =
  <p>&quot;Too often,&quot; collateral-dependent loans are downgraded to tr=
oubled status &quot;based on atypically depressed property values,&quot; ev=
en if the borrower is current with payments and there are no plans to sell =
the property in the distressed market, the letter from Koch said.</p>      =
        <p>Also, Illinois bankers are being required to hold capital &quot;=
well above&quot; regulatory minimums, she said.</p>              <p>&quot;I=
t's extremely difficult in today's environment for banks to raise additiona=
l capital, especially when so many banks are being asked to do so concurren=
tly,&quot; she said. &quot;This mandate to raise capital ratios leaves many=
 banks with no choice but to shrink their business, which results in sellin=
g assets and curtailing their lending in the very communities they're tryin=
g to serve.&quot;</p>              <p>Koch's letter also notes that Illinoi=
s bankers are &quot;frustrated&quot; by the way examiners are forcing them =
to treat many of their commercial real estate loans and brokered deposits, =
and the &quot;significant impact&quot; of the growing list of bank regulati=
ons.</p>              <p>The Fed and FDIC either couldn't be reached or had=
 no immediate comment.</p>              <p>Golden touch? Michael  Krasny, t=
he billionaire founder of CDW Corp., owns 910,000 common shares, or about 7=
.6 percent, of Taylor Capital Group Inc., parent of Cole Taylor Bank, accor=
ding to its recently released proxy. Based on Taylor's recent trading price=
, his stake is valued at nearly $14.8 million. He didn't return calls.</p> =
             <p>Banking's a bear: Brian  McCaskey, whose family owns the Ch=
icago Bears, is one of nine directors of ailing Lincoln Park Savings Bank. =
The FDIC is seeking bidders to acquire the assets and deposits of Lincoln P=
ark and six other local lenders. McCaskey is senior director of business de=
velopment for the Bears. He didn't return a call.</p>              <p>-----=

Learning the foundry business from the furnace up after World War II, Richa=
rd E. Marks went on to become part owner of Sheffield Foundry on North Clyb=
ourn Avenue in Chicago, where workers cast mammoth valves and other parts f=
rom molten metal.</p>              <p>Sheffield Foundry was closed in the 1=
980s, and a shopping center now stands in its place.</p>              <p>Mr=
. Marks, 91, died of complications from cancer Thursday, April 1, at Mather=
 LifeWays, a retirement community in Evanston, said his son Geoffry.</p>   =
           <p>Mr. Marks studied banking and worked at City National Bank on=
 LaSalle Street as a securities teller after graduating from what is now Oa=
k Park and River Forest High School.</p>              <p>He rethought his c=
areer direction after enlisting in the Army during World War II and serving=
 as a guard at a German prisoner of war camp in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.=
</p>              <p>&quot;He decided during the war he wanted to be involv=
ed in manufacturing something tangible, and not just be dealing with money =
in the abstract,&quot; his son said.</p>              <p>Mr. Marks got a jo=
b at Brighton Iron Foundry in Chicago, where the owner trained him in all a=
spects of the business. He was made a manager in 1949 and then joined Jolie=
t Foundry after Brighton was sold in 1952.</p>              <p>In 1955, he =
became a sales manager for Sheffield Foundry at 2070 N. Clybourn. Sheffield=
 manufactured a number of cast-metal items, including large butterfly valve=
s for water plants in Chicago and across the nation. A Tribune classified a=
d from 1973 indicates Sheffield Foundry was a &quot;60-man shop&quot; that =
specialized in castings from 100 to 10,000 pounds.</p>              <p>Mr. =
Marks met with clients and translated their needs into specifications for t=
he foundry foremen and pattern-makers. He was active in industry organizati=
ons and for many years was secretary of the Chicago Foundrymen's Associatio=
n.</p>              <p>He and two partners took over the foundry in a lever=
aged buyout in the early 1970s, and he worked as president until his retire=
ment in 1983. The death of a successor owner, coupled with changes in the i=
ndustry and booming real estate values along the once-industrial Clybourn c=
orridor, led to the foundry's closing.</p>              <p>While he worked =
in management, he was also skilled with his hands, having inherited lessons=
 and tools passed down from his great-grandfather, a carpenter. Mr. Marks b=
uilt garages for two of his homes and crafted furniture and other needs in =
his well-stocked home workshop.</p>              <p>Mr. Marks and his wife,=
 Janet, took in a foster son, who was one of their son's friends at New Tri=
er High School who lost his mother in 1974.</p>              <p>Now in mana=
gement with New York's rapid transit system, Lawrence Banks, who is African=
-American, recently sent everyone in the Marks family a copy of the hit mov=
ie &quot;The Blind Side,&quot; which tells the tale of a white family that =
takes in a black son.</p>              <p>Mr. Marks' wife died in October o=
n the couple's 68th wedding anniversary.</p>              <p>In addition to=
 his two sons, Mr. Marks is survived by two other sons, Andrew and Brian; a=
 daughter, Catherine Yamamoto; four sisters, Dorothy Walsh, Betty Coulter, =
Audrey Hawkinson and Nancy Riley; nine grandchildren; and a great-grandchil=
d.</p>              <p>Services were held.</p>              <p>----------</=

      <body>              <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told =
lawmakers Wednesday that regulatory failures by the central bank helped tri=
gger the financial crisis, but that doesn't mean they should strip the agen=
cy of much or all of its oversight of individual banks.</p>              <p=
>The Fed has been under intense fire for not heading off the meltdown of th=
e housing and financial markets. The criticism has been particularly harsh =
in Congress, where lawmakers are considering a sweeping overhaul of financi=
al regulations that would curtail the central bank's role in bank supervisi=
on.</p>              <p>Senate Banking Chairman Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn=
.), who has called the Fed's regulation of banks an &quot;abysmal failure,&=
quot; on Monday proposed taking away its oversight of all but about three d=
ozen of the nation's largest banks.</p>              <p>Bernanke fought bac=
k Wednesday in his first public comments about Dodd's proposal.</p>        =
      <p>The Fed is working to improve its oversight of the 6,000 small and=
 large banks that it regulates, Bernanke said. Stripping the Fed of a major=
 part of that regulatory role, he said, would deprive it of important infor=
mation about the state of the financial system and the economy that is nece=
ssary to set monetary policy.</p>              <p>&quot;We are quite concer=
ned by proposals to make the Fed a regulator only of the biggest banks,&quo=
t; Bernanke told the House Financial Services Committee. &quot;It makes us =
essentially the too-big-to-fail regulator. We don't want that responsibilit=
y. We want to have a connection to Main Street as well as to Wall Street.&q=
uot;</p>              <p>Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, now =
an economic advisor to President Obama, backed Bernanke. He told the commit=
tee it would be a &quot;really grievous mistake&quot; to remove the Fed fro=
m its role in overall bank regulation.</p>              <p>And Jeffrey Gerh=
art, president of the Bank of Newman Grove, a community bank in Nebraska, w=
arned the committee that eliminating the Fed's supervision of small banks &=
quot;could lead to a bias in favor of the largest financial institutions.&q=
uot;</p>              <p>But the Fed is not popular on Capitol Hill right n=
ow.</p>              <p>It has been criticized for waiting until 2008 -- 14=
 years after Congress granted it authority -- to enact rules on the risky s=
ubprime mortgages that wrecked the housing market.</p>              <p>And =
many lawmakers are angry about the Fed's bailouts of investment banker Bear=
 Stearns &amp; Co. and giant insurer American International Group Inc., as =
well as the trillions of dollars the central bank has pumped into the econo=
my to ease the credit crisis.</p>              <p>&quot;Where was the Fed? =
How did this happen under your watch?&quot; said Rep. David Scott (D-Ga.), =
pressing Bernanke on the reasons that 27 banks have failed in Scott's state=
 over the last three years.</p>              <p>House Republicans have prop=
osed taking away all of the Fed's oversight of banks as part of their finan=
cial regulatory overhaul so it can focus on monetary policy.</p>           =
   <p>&quot;It seems that when the Fed is responsible for monetary policy a=
nd bank supervision, its performance in both suffers,&quot; Rep. Spencer Ba=
chus (R-Ala.) said.</p>              <p>Under the House-passed financial re=
gulatory overhaul and Dodd's proposal, the Fed would gain new authority to =
regulate huge financial institutions that are not banks.</p>              <=
p>The Fed now oversees about 5,000 bank holding companies and about 850 sta=
te-chartered banks that are part of the Federal Reserve System. There are a=
bout 8,000 banks in the U.S. overall.</p>              <p>The House bill re=
tains that oversight. But Dodd has proposed stripping the Fed of regulatory=
 authority over all but the largest bank holding companies -- those with $5=
0 billion or more in assets. At the end of last year, about 35 bank holding=
 companies fit that category, including Bank of America Corp. with $2.2 tri=
llion in assets and Zions Bancorp with $51 billion in assets.</p>          =
    <p>Under Dodd's plan, regulation of the other banks under Fed oversight=
 would be shifted to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of =
the Comptroller of the Currency. The move would be a major blow to the Fed,=
 particularly many of its 12 regional banks, which would lose most of their=
 regulatory role.</p>              <p>Bernanke said the central bank had be=
en &quot;doing a lot of soul searching&quot; about its regulatory failings =
since the crisis. It has made &quot;substantial changes&quot; to how it sup=
ervises banks to improve its ability to identify potential risks in the fin=
ancial system and the broader economy, he said.</p>              <p>&quot;W=
e are working to do a better job,&quot; Bernanke said.</p>              <p>=
Those changes, along with the Fed's large stable of economists and other st=
aff, make it uniquely qualified to play a major role in banking oversight, =
Bernanke said.</p>              <p>And supervising small banks around the c=
ountry as well as large ones centered on Wall Street is vital to the Fed's =
main role of maximizing employment and curbing inflation, he said.</p>     =
         <p>&quot;We need to see what's happening in the entire financial s=
ystem,&quot; Bernanke said.</p>              <p>--</p>              <p>jim.=

      </head>            <body>              <p>Lawmakers and consumer advo=
cates have heaped accolades on Bank of America for its announcement that it=
 will stop hitting customers with $35 overdraft fees any time they don't ha=
ve enough cash to cover a debit-card purchase.</p>              <p>Rep. Car=
olyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), who has spearheaded efforts in Congress to crack dow=
n on abusive bank practices, was typical of those showering BofA with love.=
 She declared, &quot;Let me now praise Bank of America!&quot;</p>          =
    <p>It's understandable that folks who regularly criticize banks would w=
ant to hand out milk and cookies when they see something beneficial for con=
sumers.</p>              <p>But it seems pretty pathetic to sing a company'=
s praises just because it's decided to stop mistreating customers.</p>     =
         <p>I mean, is that how miserable things have gotten, that we honor=
 businesses just for doing the right thing? That we reward them for saying =
they'll quit doing something they never should have done in the first place=
?</p>              <p>In this case, BofA said the other day that it would s=
top imposing hefty overdraft fees for purchases as picayune as a cup of cof=
fee or a candy bar. Instead, it will reject any debit-card transaction that=
 can't be covered by a customer's checking account.</p>              <p>Thi=
s is, of course, the only sensible way to handle such situations -- unless =
a customer has asked in advance for overdraft protection, in which case a s=
ervice fee is clearly justifiable.</p>              <p>In fact, consumer ad=
vocates have been saying for years that banks should stop reaching into peo=
ple's pockets with these &quot;gotcha&quot; fees and should instead keep cu=
stomers from getting into trouble in the first place.</p>              <p>I=
 wrote in September that banks &quot;should use all the technological means=
 at their disposal to prevent customers from overdrawing their accounts.&qu=
ot;</p>              <p>BofA says it lacks the technical wherewithal to ale=
rt customers at the cash register that they're about to deplete their check=
ing account, so it will instead block the transaction from going through.</=
p>              <p>The change takes effect June 19 for new customers and in=
 August for existing debit-card holders.</p>              <p>Susan Faulkner=
, the senior vice president who heads BofA's debit-card business, told me t=
he change is in response to customer requests.</p>              <p>&quot;Cu=
stomers have been telling us that they don't want to spend money that they =
don't have,&quot; she said. &quot;We want to help them avoid overdraft fees=
.&quot;</p>              <p>Yep -- that's BofA's story and it's sticking to=
 it.</p>              <p>&quot;All of this is in response to our customers,=
&quot; Faulkner said. &quot;We heard it loud and clear. It's about building=
 a foundation of trust with our customers.&quot;</p>              <p>Moreov=
er: &quot;We're doing this proactively.&quot;</p>              <p>Um, yeah.=
 Except that right around the same time BofA's customer-driven policy chang=
e takes effect, so will new federal rules requiring banks to ask customers =
in advance if they want overdraft protection.</p>              <p>Show of h=
ands: How many of you would give the go-ahead for your bank to charge a $35=
 fee for overdrawing your account, rather than simply not letting the trans=
action go through if you don't have enough cash on hand?</p>              <=
p>Exactly.</p>              <p>I asked Faulkner whether BofA, aside from re=
sponding to customers' needs, isn't also responding to the looming arrival =
of new overdraft regulations.</p>              <p>&quot;We've gone way beyo=
nd what's required,&quot; she replied.</p>              <p>Actually, no. Bo=
fA is merely taking the new federal rules to their logical outcome: If hard=
ly anyone gives permission for overdraft fees to be charged, which is likel=
y, the bank will have no choice but to deny most people's transactions.</p>=
              <p>The same goes for every other bank. People will sign up fo=
r overdraft protection -- and some banks are already pushing hard to get cu=
stomers on board -- or their debit-card purchases won't go through without =
sufficient funds.</p>              <p>BofA has about 37 million debit-card =
customers, making it the market leader. Debit cards account for 60% of all =
overdrafts for the bank, BofA estimates.</p>              <p>Industrywide, =
banks have generated about $38 billion annually from service charges on dep=
osits.</p>              <p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. pointed out =
in a 2008 report that if you became overdrawn by $20, and if you got slappe=
d with a $27 overdraft fee, repaying your account within a couple of weeks =
would be the equivalent of having received a loan with an annual percentage=
 rate of 3,520%.</p>              <p>With margins like that, this isn't a b=
usiness that banks will cheerfully walk away from. So the real issue here i=
sn't how great BofA and other banks are for finally doing away with onerous=

 my bill, representing about $30 in savings.</p>              <p>This is pr=

few bucks in tax money.</p>              <p>But am I the only one who feels=
 like a sap whenever I'm asked online for a discount code and don't have on=

       <body>              <p>In a video on a new Citibank blog, the compan=
y's chief executive sits against a white backdrop and owns up to the bank's=
 role in the financial crisis.</p>              <p>&quot;It's clear that we=
 made some mistakes coming into this environment, and we have to acknowledg=
e that,&quot; the Citigroup CEO, Vikram Pandit, intones over fluttering pia=
no notes. &quot;We have to take responsibility for what we didn't do correc=
tly.&quot;</p>              <p>The simple, almost austere blog, which the C=
itigroup Inc. unit began promoting last week in magazine and newspaper ads,=
 is part of a strategic shift by the financial services industry.</p>      =
        <p>After largely avoiding public attention for the last 18 months, =
some of the country's biggest banks are trying to repair their battered ima=
ges and win back trust with earnest ad campaigns that tentatively confront =
the question of blame. Bank of America Corp., for example, has launched a w=
ebsite focused not on a credit card or checking account product but on publ=
ic perception of the bank. Pandit of Citibank and BofA's CEO, Brian Moyniha=
n, have been making appearances at individual bank branches. Even Goldman S=
achs Group Inc., known for an aloof public stance, is acknowledging critici=
sm -- with mixed results.</p>              <p>The recent moves reflect a re=
cognition that a different approach is needed to contend with the public's =
intense anger at the industry.</p>              <p>&quot;We realized that w=
e really need some really genuine, believable pathos -- look you in the eye=
 and say, 'We acknowledge the troubles, we understand maybe we could have d=
one things differently,' &quot; said Tim Pannell, CEO of Financial Marketin=
g Solutions, which creates marketing campaigns for banks.</p>              =
<p>The challenge facing the industry is formidable. In a Gallup poll last y=
ear, only 19% of Americans surveyed expressed confidence in the integrity o=
f bankers, down from 41% in 2005 and the lowest level since Gallup began as=
king the question in 1976.</p>              <p>With such negative perceptio=
ns of financial firms, Citibank decided to promote changes the company had =
already made, said Lisa Caputo, a marketing executive at the company.</p>  =
            <p>&quot;It's really important that people see that we have a n=
ew management team in place and a new risk management system,&quot; Caputo =
said. &quot;We've changed the way we operate, and that's a significant even=
t that people should know about given the perception that is clearly out th=
ere about banks.&quot;</p>              <p>When Moynihan took over as CEO o=
f Bank of America at the start of the year, he wrote a newspaper op-ed colu=
mn, which the company's blog immediately linked to, in which he acknowledge=
d the industry's responsibility for the financial and economic bust.</p>   =
           <p>&quot;The recent surge of growth in financial services went w=
ay too far,&quot; Moynihan wrote. &quot;And while there were many causes of=
 the economic bubble and bust, too much growth in financial services was no=
 doubt a big factor.&quot;</p>              <p>The recent wave of marketing=
 has taken banks into some uncharacteristically touchy-feely places. Bank o=
f America now has six staffers responding sympathetically to customer compl=
aints via Twitter. Last month, the American Bankers Assn. hosted the first =
of a three-part seminar on using social media in marketing.</p>            =
  <p>&quot;Banking in the past has been very narrow -- and the industry has=
 been a lot about control,&quot; Pannell said. &quot;Now the consumer is in=
 control.&quot;</p>              <p>When the credit crisis unfolded in 2008=
, many banks struggled to find the right message to send. The first ads typ=
ically followed an old script of pointing to their history of stability. Th=
at worked until giant financial institutions started going under.</p>      =
        <p>Once the crisis intensified and the government invested hundreds=
 of billions to rescue the financial system, many banks decided that no mes=
sage was the best message, at least as far as corporate-image advertising w=
as concerned.</p>              <p>Recipients of bailout money particularly =
wanted to avoid the impression that the money was being spent on anything o=
ther than essential functions. Companies also concluded that an angry publi=
c was unlikely to believe their marketing.</p>              <p>&quot;We rec=
ognized that we couldn't simply advertise our way out of these issues,&quot=
; said Meredith Verdone, a marketing executive at Bank of America.</p>     =
         <p>Ad spending for financial services dropped 25% last year from 2=
008's level, according to research firm Kantar. The spending has begun to t=
urn around only in the last two months, executives say.</p>              <p=
>As an investment bank, Goldman Sachs typically has little need to advertis=
e to the public. Although the company emerged from the financial crisis wit=
h a good balance, it also has faced perhaps more criticism than any other c=
ompany in the industry. In a regulatory filing this week, the company added=
 &quot;adverse publicity&quot; to its list of factors that could pose signi=
ficant risk to its business.</p>              <p>In recent months, Goldman =
has made an effort to open up to the public via interviews and appearances.=
 But the firm still has seemed wary of taking any responsibility for the fi=
nancial crisis, and some of its public comments have cemented a reputation =
for haughtiness. In one case, a company spokesman told ABC News that specul=
ation about the firm's executive compensation was &quot;ill-informed and, f=
rankly, pretty stupid.&quot;</p>              <p>Marketing experts say the =
danger of the new campaigns is that they may be promoting changes that don'=
t reflect how the banks are really doing business.</p>              <p>&quo=
t;Saying something and then not having it be true could make things dramati=
cally worse in this climate,&quot; said Douglas Berlon, who consults with b=
anks for Gallup.</p>              <p>Berlon said his research indicated tha=
t banks &quot;are still doing a lot of the same behaviors they've done in t=
he past. I don't know if they have the resources to really implement the ne=
w brands and the new feel.&quot;</p>              <p>--</p>              <p=

ing, and the real estate deals gone south are piling up at Broadway Bank, t=
he lending institution owned by the family of U.S. Senate candidate Alexi G=
iannoulias.</p>              <p>Many U.S. banks are struggling amid the wor=
st financial crisis since the Depression. Almost monthly, at least one Illi=
nois lender has collapsed, seized by the government because of poor perform=
ance, often due to real estate loans turned sour.</p>              <p>At on=
ce-successful Broadway, headquartered in a former car dealership in the Edg=
ewater neighborhood of Chicago, the situation has turned awful at an inoppo=
rtune time for the Illinois treasurer. Less than a week before Giannoulias'=
 Democratic primary election victory earlier this month, the scope of the p=
roblems at Broadway became clearer after a regulatory order was made public=
 saying the bank has just three months to get its financial house in order.=
</p>              <p>Broadway's struggles have put Giannoulias on the defen=
sive as Republicans eyeing Barack Obama's old Senate seat question what rol=
e he played in the bank's problems. Giannoulias, a friend of Obama's who is=
 facing U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk, the GOP nominee, in the November race, has rep=
eatedly said he hasn't worked at the bank in four years.</p>              <=
p>Still, the situation could become more politically harmful and provide mo=
re ammunition for the GOP if the family-owned bank is taken over by the fed=
eral government before Election Day.</p>              <p>Broadway's chief e=
xecutive, Demetris Giannoulias, Alexi Giannoulias' older brother, told the =
Tribune the family must raise at least $85 million by the end of April to s=
tave off government seizure.</p>              <p>Demetris Giannoulias said =
he doesn't expect the government to drag its feet on shutting the bank if c=
apital-raising efforts come up short.</p>              <p>&quot;Regulators =
aren't cutting us any slack,&quot; said Demetris Giannoulias, 38, whose fat=
her founded the bank in 1979.</p>              <p>The Giannoulias family, w=
hich has owned the bank outright since the mid-1990s and has taken out mill=
ions in dividends, &quot;will put in a big chunk of new money,&quot; Gianno=
ulias said. But &quot;we don't have $85 million,&quot; he said, explaining =
that the family's other business investments, primarily real estate, also h=
ave been battered.</p>              <p>Alexi Giannoulias, in a separate int=
erview, said he has told his family that if they need help financially from=
 him, &quot;I'll do anything I can.&quot; He said his family hasn't asked f=
or his financial assistance and declined to say how much he would put in.</=
p>              <p>Depending on how much money the bank might be able to ra=
ise, the family is contemplating ways to contribute 10 percent to 20 percen=
t, Demetris Giannoulias said.</p>              <p>For a bank with so many p=
roblems, raising funds &quot;will be tough,&quot; Demetris Giannoulias said=
.</p>              <p>The predicament is a huge turnabout for the family.</=
p>              <p>From 2004 through 2006, Broadway was one of the country'=
s most profitable community banks, according to SNL Financial, which collec=
ts bank industry data. But then the recession hit, shell-shocking both borr=
owers who were suddenly unable to make payments on loans and the bank itsel=
f. Broadway relied almost strictly on real estate deals to make money, and =
the financial crisis wreaked havoc on that market as business activity drie=
d up and real estate values plummeted.</p>              <p>&quot;We always =
felt that the safest type of lending was commercial real estate,&quot; Deme=
tris Giannoulias said. &quot;Values going down 50 percent was never in the =
business model.&quot;</p>              <p>In good times the real estate loa=
ns kept Broadway flush. But with real estate-related loans making up 96 per=
cent of its total loans, the bank last year lost $75.3 million. In comparis=
on, the exposure to real estate loans at U.S. banks in general is about 58 =
percent, according to SNL.</p>              <p>Of Broadway's $903 million i=
n loans, $185.9 million were seriously delinquent as of Dec. 31, the bank r=
eported to regulators. That represents more than 20 percent of its loans, u=
p from 8 percent at the end of 2008. It also ended the year with $56.4 mill=
ion in foreclosed real estate, up from $32.7 million in 2008.</p>          =
    <p>&quot;When the commercial real estate loan performance deteriorated,=
 the related losses eroded capital, bringing the bank's capital ratios from=
 above 'well capitalized' levels to below regulators' minimum guidelines,&q=
uot; said Matthew Anderson, partner of Foresight Analytics LLC, an Oakland,=
 Calif.-based company that analyzes banking industry trends.</p>           =
   <p>Broadway was one of at least 16 Illinois banks undercapitalized as of=
 Dec. 31, according to bank tracker TheStreet.com.</p>              <p>Of B=
roadway's more than $240 million in seriously delinquent loans and foreclos=
ed real estate, Demetris Giannoulias said, 9 percent of the value of those =
deals originated during Alexi Giannoulias' tenure as the bank's chief loan =
officer from 2002 through 2006, when he left to successfully run for state =
treasurer.</p>              <p>Since 2007, Broadway Bank has filed dozens o=
f foreclosures on various properties, including several against Michael Gio=
rango, a convicted bookmaker and prostitution ring promoter who has become =
a political albatross in Alexi Giannoulias' campaigns.</p>              <p>=
During Alexi Giannoulias' tenure at Broadway, the bank approved loans to Gi=
orango for various real estate deals. Alexi Giannoulias has acknowledged he=
 serviced some Giorango loans and went to Miami to inspect Giorango propert=
y the bank financed.</p>              <p>Giorango is likely to play a role =
in the coming months. One of Broadway's more recent cases, filed in Cook Co=
unty, was in June against Giorango and other business partners involving a =
$2.2 million foreclosure of a building at 1201-1205 S. Western Ave.</p>    =
          <p>Giorango declined to comment through an attorney.</p>         =
     <p>In December, the bank entered into a deed-in-lieu-of-foreclosure ag=
reement, basically taking back the property, court records show.</p>       =
       <p>Demetris Giannoulias, a Yale University economics and sociology g=
raduate, said one of the few options for Broadway Bank to raise money is th=
rough private-equity firms.</p>              <p>But that won't be easy. For=
 one thing, many private-equity firms won't bother doing deals of less than=
 $100 million, he said. For another, banking regulations make it unappealin=
g for private-equity firms to take more than, say, a 25 percent ownership s=
take. Exceeding that threshold would force such firms to register as bank h=
olding companies. That would open up a typically secretive industry to more=
 scrutiny in the highly regulated banking world.</p>              <p>A purc=
hase of Broadway by another bank is virtually off the table, Demetris Giann=
oulias said. That's because many healthy banks believe it makes more sense =
to wait until a lender fails before swooping in for the deposits, assets an=
d branches. That way, the acquiring bank can usually strike a deal with the=
 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. that limits its losses.</p>              <=
p>Also, with only four branches, including its 5960 N. Broadway headquarter=
s, Broadway has scant franchise value, providing little incentive for anoth=
er institution to fashion a deal before its collapse.</p>              <p>D=
uring 2007 and 2008, Broadway paid the family about $70 million in dividend=
s. Is the family in a position to bail the bank out?</p>              <p>De=
metris Giannoulias said most of the money was used to pay corporate taxes a=
nd for estate planning after the 2006 death of family's patriarch, Alexis G=
iannoulias. Even after the dividends, the bank was still well capitalized, =
he said.</p>              <p>As recently as June 2008, &quot;we still felt =
things were going OK,&quot; Demetris Giannoulias said. &quot;When we made t=
he dividend, we still thought our income would be up.&quot;</p>            =
  <p>After the U.S. financial crisis began in late 2008, the Treasury Depar=
tment rolled out the Troubled Asset Relief Program, commonly known as the b=
ank bailout program. Broadway considered applying but didn't.</p>          =
    <p>&quot;We had enough capital&quot; at the time, Demetris Giannoulias =
said</p>              <p>Now, many troubled banks are seeking help from leg=
islators. But Demetris Giannoulias realizes he's in an awkward spot.</p>   =
           <p>&quot;It's a little delicate with my brother,&quot; he said. =
&quot;I stay up at night thinking of what I'd tell someone.&quot;</p>      =
        <p>In retrospect, Demetris Giannoulias wishes that Broadway had mad=
e no loans in 2007 or 2008.</p>              <p>&quot;I wish I would have l=
ocked the doors,&quot; he said. &quot;I'd be sitting pretty now.&quot;</p> =

 <p>James Hadley stepped up when Providence St. Mel School was struggling t=
o stay alive in the late 1970s.</p>              <p>A community banker in C=
hicago's Lawndale neighborhood, Mr. Hadley successfully guided the West Sid=
e school as chairman of its board for eight years starting in 1978, when it=
 reopened as a private, independent school following the Catholic archdioce=
se's decision to close it.</p>              <p>&quot;When everyone else was=
 running away, he was coming toward us,&quot; said Paul J. Adams III, Provi=
dence St. Mel's president. &quot;He just hung in there with us.&quot;</p>  =
            <p>Mr. Hadley, 79, died Friday, Feb. 19, at NorthShore Universi=
ty HealthSystem Skokie Hospital of complications from a stroke he suffered =
in 2008, said his daughter, Hilary. He was a resident of Chicago's South Sh=
ore neighborhood.</p>              <p>Through a long career in banking, Mr.=
 Hadley's enduring role was as a sower of new businesses and, just as impor=
tant to him, a mentor to young people, his daughter said.</p>              =
<p>In addition to his work with Providence St. Mel, where he was a life tru=
stee, he was a founding member of Concerned Christian Men, which provides b=
usiness and economic training for at-risk boys in the Chicago Public School=
s.</p>              <p>&quot;I don't think I ever talked to Jim when he was=
n't talking about children, especially young men,&quot; Adams said.</p>    =
          <p>Raised in Arkansas, Mr. Hadley left the day after graduating f=
rom high school in search of greater opportunity in Chicago.</p>           =
   <p>He served in the Army and worked at a West Side tailor shop run by hi=
s sister and brother-in-law. The job enabled him to attend the University o=
f Illinois at Chicago.</p>              <p>He received a bachelor's degree =
in business and later a master's in business administration from the Univer=
sity of Chicago.</p>              <p>He got a job with Continental Bank in =
the early 1960s, working his way up to an executive position in the persona=
l banking department.</p>              <p>&quot;We called him one of the pi=
oneers,&quot; said Dennis Irvin, president and chief executive officer of H=
ighland Community Bank, noting that there were few African- Americans worki=
ng as bankers when Mr. Hadley started out. &quot;He was one of the early gu=
ys in the arena.&quot;</p>              <p>In the mid-1970s, he left Contin=
ental for a considerably riskier proposition, starting a new bank on the ec=
onomically depressed West Side. The Community Bank of Lawndale was chartere=
d in 1977, and over the next decade, Mr. Hadley, its president, spent many =
evenings reaching out to churches, hospitals and schools in an effort to dr=
um up business and revitalize the area's moribund economic base.</p>       =
       <p>&quot;His big thing was community and education,&quot; his daught=
er said. &quot;He liked growing things, nurturing business and nurturing in=
dividuals.&quot;</p>              <p>Mr. Hadley served on the boards of Mou=
nt Sinai and Schwab Rehabilitation hospitals, as well as West Side counseli=
ng and community centers. Active beyond the neighborhood as well, he was ap=
pointed to the Illinois Lottery Control Board in 1999 and later served as i=
ts chairman.</p>              <p>An avid traveler, Mr. Hadley decided to mi=
x business with pleasure when he opened a travel agency in 1991. He ran tha=
t business for just a few years before being recruited for a position with =
Highland Community Bank, an African- American-owned institution on the Sout=
h Side.</p>              <p>At Highland, where he retired as a vice preside=
nt and director of marketing and development, Mr. Hadley put his many conta=
cts to use in an effort to spur community investment and growth.</p>       =
       <p>&quot;Jim always maintained a high profile in the street,&quot; s=
aid Irvin, who also noted Mr. Hadley?s easygoing demeanor.</p>             =
 <p>&quot;He just had a character and style that made you comfortable aroun=
d him. Jim just made you feel good,&quot; Irvin said. Mr. Hadley retired fr=
om the bank in 2006.</p>              <p>Mr. Hadley is also survived by his=
 wife of 56 years, Gloria; a son, Keith; a sister, Freda Miller (the one-ti=

p>After a long and successful career with First National Bank of Chicago, A=
lexander &quot;Al&quot; Glover formed his own business, doing management co=
nsulting for banks in the suburbs.</p>              <p>&quot;He had an expe=
rtise in banking and wanted to share it,&quot; said his daughter, Eileen Be=
ckey. &quot;He worked with smaller banks because he understood their import=
ance within a community.&quot;</p>              <p>Indeed, the lifelong Lak=
e Forest resident was a fixture in his community, where he served as an ald=
erman for three two-year terms, headed the local American Legion post and s=
erved as the grand marshal of the annual Lake Forest Day Parade in 2005.</p=
>              <p>&quot;He was very patriotic and placed a high value on ci=
vic duty,&quot; his daughter said.</p>              <p>Mr. Glover, 90, a Wo=
rld War II veteran and a past commander of American Legion Post 264, died T=
hursday, Feb. 4, in hospice care at Westmoreland Nursing Center in Lake For=
est.</p>              <p>During World War II, Mr. Glover served in the Navy=
 aboard ships where he battled German submarines in waters off the coast of=
 Brazil. In 1945, while on military leave, he married his wife of 64 years,=
 Catherine. During their honeymoon in Milwaukee, the couple learned that th=
e atomic bomb had been dropped on Japan.</p>              <p>&quot;He was p=
roud of his service to his country and was a true example of the greatest g=
eneration,&quot; his daughter said.</p>              <p>After his military =
discharge, Mr. Glover began working as an officer trainee with First Nation=
al Bank. He rose through the ranks, becoming a vice president in the loan d=
epartment before his departure in 1976. He later formed his own consulting =
firm, Al Glover &amp; Associates, which he operated for several years.</p> =
             <p>From 1969 to 1975, Mr. Glover served on the Lake Forest Cit=
y Council as an alderman. Later, he made an unsuccessful bid for mayor but =
remained active in local politics, providing what he called the &quot;taxpa=
yers' viewpoint,&quot; family members said.</p>              <p>&quot;Peopl=
e might not have agreed with him on all issues, but they knew what he stood=
 for and respected his opinions,&quot; his daughter said.</p>              =
<p>As a longtime Legionnaire, Mr. Glover was known for his passion of honor=
ing the American flag. In the late 1950s, he spearheaded an effort to post =
about 500 flags at locations around the city for several national holidays.=
</p>              <p>&quot;When Al was a younger man, he'd spend hours on h=
olidays posting flags around the city,&quot; recalled Larry Crone, a close =
friend and fellow Legionnaire. &quot;For him, it was a matter of honor.&quo=
t;</p>              <p>In addition to his wife and daughter, Mr. Glover is =
survived by a son, Tom; a brother, Kenneth; four grandchildren; and a great=
-grandson.</p>              <p>Services have been held.</p>              <p=

     </head>            <body>              <p>The former owners of the fai=
led Harvey-based Mutual Bank have sued the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. =
over $32.9 million in losses they suffered when the bank was declared insol=
vent in July.</p>              <p>Pethinaidu Veluchamy and other members of=
 his family say the federal banking regulator improperly denied the bank's =
request to redeem subordinated debt they had purchased to boost the bank's =
capital.</p>              <p>Mutual Bank was among several business that th=
e family controlled. The Indian-born Veluchamy built a direct-marketing bus=
iness from scratch that is based in Downers Grove. Mutual Bank, which he bo=
ught in 1998, was run by Amrish Mahajan, a major political contributor to f=
ormer Gov. Rod Blagojevich.</p>              <p>The FDIC began expressing c=
oncerns about Mutual Bank's capital levels in June 2008, according to the s=
uit filed Friday in federal court in Chicago. To meet requirements, Velucha=
my family members bought more than $3 million of stock in parent First Mutu=
al Bancorp of Illinois Inc. and $17.1 million in subordinated notes, the su=
it said.</p>              <p>In December 2008, federal and state banking re=
gulators issued a &quot;cease and desist&quot; order requiring the bank to =
raise more capital and recognize more loan losses, the suit said. Veluchamy=
 family members purchased an additional $7.1 million in stock and debt.</p>=
              <p>Regulators took further action against the bank in May, as=
 more loans soured.</p>              <p>In July, according to the suit, the=
 bank asked the FDIC if it could pay back the notes, and the Veluchamys wou=
ld keep the proceeds on deposit at the bank in an interest-free account. Bu=
t the FDIC refused the bank's request, the suit said, and on July 31 seized=
 it and transferred its deposits to United Central Bank in Texas.</p>      =
        <p>An FDIC spokesman declined to comment on the suit.</p>          =

      <body>              <p>First Regional Bank of Century City on Friday =
became the first California bank this year to be shut down by regulators, a=
 victim of real estate loans that went bad.</p>              <p>The Federal=
 Deposit Insurance Corp. immediately sold First Regional's eight branches a=
nd nearly all of its $2.2 billion in assets to First-Citizens Bank &amp; Tr=
ust Co. of Raleigh, N.C., which agreed to assume the failed institution's d=
eposits.</p>              <p>The FDIC agreed to shoulder most of the losses=
 on First Regional's loans, and estimated the failure would cost the bank d=
eposit insurance fund $825.5 million.</p>              <p>First Regional's =
branches are to reopen Monday as part of First-Citizens, which operates und=
er the name First Citizens Bank and is a unit of publicly traded First Citi=
zens Bancshares Inc.</p>              <p>Customers of First Regional can co=
ntinue to write checks as usual and withdraw cash using their ATM cards, an=
d their deposits will remain insured by the FDIC, the agency said.</p>     =
         <p>The deal marks the second acquisition of a failed California ba=
nk by First Citizens, which had $18.5 billion in assets at the end of 2009.=
 In July it bought 11-branch Temecula Valley Bank in the Inland Empire and =
San Diego County. In September it acquired a failed bank in Washington stat=
e.</p>              <p>Friday's deal gives First Citizens a total of 380 br=
anches in seven states, including Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee and Ma=
ryland as well as North Carolina.</p>              <p>Like other institutio=
ns that have failed in the wake of the housing market's collapse, First Reg=
ional overextended itself on construction lending during the boom years. It=
 had seven full-service branches in Los Angeles County and one in Irvine, w=
ith nearly $1.9 billion in deposits.</p>              <p>It was the 14th FD=
IC-insured bank to fail in the country this year. Earlier Friday saw the fa=
ilures of two banks in Georgia, one in North Dakota and one in Florida. Lat=
er in the day regulators took over a bank in Washington state.</p>         =
     <p>In 2009, 140 U.S. banks failed -- 17 of them in California -- the m=
ost since 1992 at the end of the savings and loan crisis.</p>              =
<p>Founded in 1979 as Great American Bank, the Century City bank became Fir=
st Regional in 1987. Of its $2 billion in loans as of Sept. 30, more than a=
 third were for construction and land development. It also has major portfo=
lios of commercial mortgages and apartment loans.</p>              <p>Last =
February, the bank consented to an order from the FDIC requiring it to stre=
ngthen its lending policies and raise capital. The Federal Reserve slapped =
a similar order on the parent company, First Regional Bancorp, in April. Bu=
t the bank's capital levels instead declined as its loan portfolio deterior=
ated.</p>              <p>--</p>              <p>scott.reckard@latimes.com<=

nce said of Richard Wagner's music that it was &quot;better than it sounds.=
&quot; The same might be said of President Barack Obama's policy toward ban=
ks.</p>              <p>Lately the president has taken every opportunity to=
 impersonate Huey Long, as when he reviled &quot;fat cat bankers on Wall St=
reet&quot; who &quot;just don't get it.&quot; He has demanded that they loo=
sen up on lending. He has denounced bonuses paid to bank executives as &quo=
t;obscene.&quot; Not only that, but Obama has proposed some changes to make=
 life less pleasant for financial institutions and the people running them.=
</p>              <p>Both the rhetoric and the impulse behind it are unders=
tandable. Banks helped set off the financial panic that cratered the econom=
y in the fall of 2008. Their ill-informed bet on mortgage-backed securities=
 forced Washington to come to the rescue with the Troubled Asset Relief Pro=
gram, which provided $700 billion to buy this bad debt.</p>              <p=
>Taxpayers were confronted with an infuriating choice: either rescue these =
companies from their stupidity or wreck the economy. Nobody was happy then,=
 and nobody is happy now. So nobody enjoys contemplating the fat bonuses pa=
id before and after the bailout.</p>              <p>Obama's response is to=
 reclaim some of that money as the price for the life preserver. He recentl=
y proposed a new tax on bank assets intended to bring in $90 billion over t=
he next decade -- almost enough to cover the possible $117 billion in event=
ual TARP losses.</p>              <p>The banks complain, understandably, th=
at they have already repaid what they borrowed. The anticipated shortfall i=
n TARP will come mostly from aid to General Motors, Chrysler and insurance =
giant AIG. But you can't recover money from companies that are already weak=
.</p>              <p>In any case, the banks, after being saved from their =
own mistakes, are in a poor position to invoke fairness as a defense. What =
was fair about the bailout? Besides, the tax will discourage future bankers=
 from taking risks that might require Washington's assistance.</p>         =
     <p>The administration has also undertaken to avert future meltdowns. T=
he main change would be to bar most banks from owning or investing in priva=
te equity companies, hedge funds and the like, which can be riskier than tr=
aditional banking activities.</p>              <p>Is that the best approach=
? Not necessarily. Douglas Diamond, a professor at the University of Chicag=
o Booth School of Business, thinks higher capital requirements would better=
 serve the same purpose. But he agrees that &quot;it makes some sense to ha=
ve some limit on extreme risks if you have a government safety net.&quot;</=
p>              <p>The trick here is to square the freedom of banks to oper=
ate as they see fit with the interest of the public in not having to bear t=
he costs of their recklessness or bad judgment. Obama may not have exactly =
the right balance. But the old one certainly won't do.</p>            </bod=

         <p>Wall Street may be drawing attention for its rebounding profits=
, but not all big banks are rolling in dough.</p>              <p>On Tuesda=
y, Citigroup posted a $7.6-billion loss for the last three months of 2009, =
the banking giant's first unprofitable quarter since 2008. Similar bad news=
 is expected today when Bank of America Inc., Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and U.S=
. Bancorp report their earnings.</p>              <p>Although these commerc=
ial banks may have substantial Wall Street operations, they rely heavily on=
 bread-and-butter consumer lending -- a business whose problems only now ma=
y be peaking along with the joblessness and other financial woes of ordinar=
y Americans.</p>              <p>The picture is very different at Wall Stre=
et pillars Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley, which mainly serve =
the financial needs of the world's largest companies.</p>              <p>T=
hese investment banks were hit early in the financial crisis due to their h=
eavy involvement in the market for mortgage-backed securities, which crashe=
d in 2008.</p>              <p>By the end of that year, of the five major W=
all Street firms, only Goldman and Morgan Stanley were still standing as in=
dependent firms.</p>              <p>And they recovered swiftly in 2009, al=
lowing for the return of fat compensation packages. Morgan Stanley is expec=
ted to report strong fourth-quarter results today with Goldman Sachs follow=
ing Thursday.</p>              <p>&quot;In the case of Goldman and Morgan S=
tanley, you don't have to deal with the consumer -- and the outcome is good=
 for them,&quot; said Richard Bove, a bank analyst at brokerage Rochdale Se=
curities. &quot;On the other hand, when you look at one of these big univer=
sal banks, they have these huge credit-card and automotive-loan divisions. =
They are all up to their heads in mud.&quot;</p>              <p>Even JPMor=
gan Chase Inc., which last week reported a $3.3-billion fourth-quarter prof=
it, had losses in its retail lending and credit-card operations. The profit=
 came largely from its investment banking and private equity divisions.</p>=
              <p>At Citigroup, most of the fourth-quarter loss stemmed from=
 an accounting charge linked to the company's exit from the government's Tr=
oubled Asset Relief Program. Even without that charge, Citigroup would have=
 lost $1.4 billion in the period.</p>              <p>The bank's ugliest re=
sults came in consumer banking, where losses widened from the third quarter=
.</p>              <p>&quot;U.S. consumer credit remains an issue,&quot; Ci=
tigroup Chief Executive Vikram Pandit said in a conference call Tuesday.</p=
>              <p>Although the results were worse than expected, Citigroup'=
s shares jumped 12 cents, or 3.5%, to $3.54, apparently because the company=
 added less in the latest period than in the third quarter to its accountin=
g provisions for future loan losses.</p>              <p>&quot;Things have =
gotten worse, but at a much slower rate,&quot; said Gerard Cassidy, a bank =
analyst at RBC Capital Markets in Portland, Maine.</p>              <p>Amon=
g the big banks, few have suffered as much as Citigroup from the mortgage m=
eltdown and resulting crises and market downturns.</p>              <p>For =
years, the company gobbled up firms from every corner of the financial real=
m, turning itself into a global financial supermarket.</p>              <p>=
As a result, it got hit on all sides when the troubles began, especially on=
 its stake in securitized mortgages. Last year, the company sold 14 divisio=
ns, including the storied Smith Barney brokerage.</p>              <p>Citig=
roup's fourth-quarter loss, amounting to 33 cents a share, was significantl=
y better than its loss of $17.2 billion, or $3.40 a share, a year earlier a=
t the height of the financial crisis.</p>              <p>Still, Citigroup'=
s stock fell 51% last year and remains down 47% from the end of 2008.</p>  =
            <p>The biggest contributor to the latest loss was Citigroup's s=
wift push to leave TARP at least in part to escape the government's oversig=
ht on matters such as executive compensation.</p>              <p>In Decemb=
er the company paid back the remainder of the $45 billion it received under=
 TARP, but it also had to pull out of an agreement under which the governme=
nt would have shared losses on some of Citigroup's loan portfolio. That hel=
ped lead to a $10.1-billion pretax charge against earnings for the quarter.=
</p>              <p>Citigroup's decision to pay back the government money =
was controversial, in part because to do so the company had to sell more co=
mmon stock, diluting the stakes of its existing shareholders.</p>          =
    <p>Among the earnings reports due today, Bank of America has a massive =
credit-card operation that is expected to show big losses.</p>             =
 <p>Bank of America also has a large mortgage portfolio that it acquired wh=
en it purchased Calabasas home-loan giant Countrywide.</p>              <p>=
Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, acquired its own set of troubled loans=
 in 2008 when it bought Wachovia and its California-heavy mortgage portfoli=
o.</p>              <p>&quot;It's a meaningful chunk of the portfolio, and =
an even more meaningful chunk of their losses,&quot; said Bart Narter, seni=
or vice president at consulting firm Celent in San Francisco.</p>          =
    <p>Politically, the hottest numbers from Citigroup's earnings report ar=
e likely to be its compensation figures.</p>              <p>The company pu=
t aside $6.3 billion in the fourth quarter to compensate its employees, an =
increase from the previous quarter and enough to give $94,290 to each of it=
s 265,000 employees for the year.</p>              <p>Citigroup did not fol=
low the lead of banking giant JP Morgan Chase, which shrank its compensatio=
n pool in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter amid the publi=
c uproar over banker bonuses. At the very top, however, Citigroup's Pandit =
has said he will forgo a bonus for 2009.</p>              <p>--</p>        =

Street executives aren't famous for their humility, but they reached a new =
level of tone-deaf hubris in their recovery from the collapse of 2008. A nu=
mber of top banks and investment firms have racked up outsized profits in r=
ecent months, sending their bonus checks through the roof. Goldman Sachs, f=
or example, set aside $16.7 billion for employee compensation -- and that's=
 just for the first nine months of 2009.</p>              <p>This despite t=
he fact that many of the same companies were in danger of going under just =
a year and a half ago, only to be rescued by federal bailout dollars and ex=
traordinarily generous credit terms from the Federal Reserve. Washington no=
t only pumped tax dollars into banks through the Troubled Asset Relief Prog=
ram, it practically guaranteed them easy profits by providing capital at vi=
rtually no cost or risk -- money the banks lent only to the safest of borro=
wers.</p>              <p>Not surprisingly, some politicians have responded=
 by calling for punitive taxes on Wall Street bonuses. And Thursday, Presid=
ent Obama used the bonus issue to sell a new tax on giant banks, brokers an=
d insurers that's designed to recoup TARP losses, saying, &quot;If these co=
mpanies are in good enough shape to afford massive bonuses, they are surely=
 in good enough shape to afford paying back every penny to taxpayers.&quot;=
</p>              <p>But all this anger, while understandable, distracts Wa=
shington from what should be its primary objective: to avert future bailout=
s by making sure no company is too big to fail. Rather than trying to punis=
h bankers, Congress should give federal agencies better tools to detect and=
 deter excessive risk-taking. It should also require Wall Street giants to =
keep larger reserves against potential losses. And it should equip regulato=
rs to shut struggling companies without sending the financial system into s=
hock. Although bills to accomplish these goals are moving forward, they are=
 a long way from the finish line. Obama's proposed tax would actually send =
the right signal to banks -- their tax liability would go up as they took o=
n more risk. But tying the proposal to Wall Street's bonuses is just demago=
guery.</p>              <p>Big bonuses may be offensive to Americans still =
suffering from the recession, but in the long run, they are problematic onl=
y if they reward executives for risky bets that seem to pay off in the shor=
t run but sour over time. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. took a promis=
ing step this week, proposing to charge higher deposit insurance premiums t=
o banks whose compensation practices encourage too much risk-taking.</p>   =
           <p>Still, the best response to egregiously large bonuses is to e=
liminate the possibility of a future federal bailout, so companies will be =
fully responsible for their own fates. Taxpayers may still resent how much =
bankers make, but at least their bonuses won't have come with federal help.=

     </head>            <body>              <p>These guys have to be some o=
f the dumbest scammers ever. But their ploy is so brazen -- and so potentia=
lly attractive in these tough economic times -- you could just see it succe=
eding.</p>              <p>That is, if they ever get their story straight.<=
/p>              <p>Beverly Hills resident Joy Shefter told me she had rece=
ived a call the other day from a man identifying himself as a Bank of Ameri=
ca employee. He said he had a cashier's check for Shefter's husband, Milt, =
from Publishers Clearing House. The check was for $2.5 million.</p>        =
      <p>How did Shefter want the money delivered?</p>              <p>&quo=
t;I was surprised,&quot; she told me. &quot;This sounded great. But it also=
 sounded suspicious.&quot;</p>              <p>Her concerns only grew when =
the purported BofA employee, who said his name was Mark Blake, said he'd ne=
ed information from her husband to verify his identity. He left a number wi=
th a New York area code.</p>              <p>&quot;It couldn't have been mo=
re than four minutes later that I got another call,&quot; Shefter said. &qu=
ot;This time it was a man who said he worked for Wachovia bank, and that he=
 also had a check from Publishers Clearing House for $2.5 million.&quot;</p=
>              <p>She replied that she'd just received a similar call from =
BofA. The man quickly hung up.</p>              <p>Like I say, not the shar=
pest con artists you're ever going to meet. But, as you'll see, they get po=
ints for persistence.</p>              <p>Bank of America -- the real one -=
- was royally miffed to learn that it's being so prominently featured in a =
scam.</p>              <p>&quot;These calls were not from or authorized by =
Bank of America,&quot; said Colleen Haggerty, a bank spokeswoman. &quot;We =
will be investigating the matter.&quot;</p>              <p>Wells Fargo &am=
p; Co., which acquired Wachovia last year, was similarly displeased.</p>   =
           <p>&quot;Unfortunately, phony lottery or sweepstakes scams are c=
ommon,&quot; said Jennifer Langan, a bank spokeswoman.</p>              <p>=
Shefter contacted me after receiving the two calls. She related how she cou=
ld hear in the background other voices telling other people about their mul=
timillion-dollar winnings.</p>              <p>&quot;Ocean's Eleven&quot; t=
his wasn't.</p>              <p>Shefter asked what she should do if Blake c=
alled back. I said she and her husband should push to get the $2.5-million =
check, if it really existed.</p>              <p>The next day, Blake left a=
 message with the Shefters asking them to call. This time, he gave a number=
 with a Jamaica area code.</p>              <p>Jamaica. Must be a BofA bran=
ch office.</p>              <p>When Milt Shefter called Blake, he was told =
that no further information was needed. Blake said he was ready to dispatch=
 the check.</p>              <p>Now comes the fun part. Blake told Shefter =
that the International Release Service -- get it, &quot;IRS&quot;? -- requi=
res payment of taxes in advance for such large winnings and requires the se=
rvices of a &quot;merchant banker.&quot;</p>              <p>Luckily, Blake=
 said he could provide just such a banker, a woman named Tiffany Davis (nic=
e touch).</p>              <p>&quot;He told me I had to wire her $850 throu=
gh Western Union, and then I'd receive my check,&quot; Shefter said. &quot;=
It seemed like a good deal.&quot;</p>              <p>Indeed, that's a tax =
rate of less than 1%. The IRS must be getting soft.</p>              <p>But=
 Shefter told Blake he was still wary of the deal. So Blake said he'd fax a=
 copy of the check, which would allow Shefter to see that everything was le=
git.</p>              <p>The fax arrived shortly afterward. The check looke=
d real enough. It said &quot;Publishers Clearing House International Sweeps=
takes&quot; across the top, and it was written to Shefter in the amount of =
$2.5 million.</p>              <p>Just one small thing: The check was seemi=
ngly drawn on a Wachovia bank account, not BofA.</p>              <p>Shefte=
r called Blake. He said he thought Blake worked for BofA.</p>              =
<p>Blake replied that Publishers Clearing House has accounts at both banks.=
 There.</p>              <p>The Shefters and I have been chuckling about th=
is for days. As of Tuesday, Blake had called back several times asking when=
 the money would be wired, and the Shefters have replied each time that the=
y need to receive the check first.</p>              <p>Impasse.</p>        =
      <p>&quot;There are some very brilliant scammers out there,&quot; Milt=
 Shefter told me. &quot;These aren't them. On a scale from 1 to 10, I'd giv=
e them a 1.&quot;</p>              <p>But he said you had to admire the tho=
roughness of the scam and the lengths to which the scammers were willing to=
 go to get their hands on people's money.</p>              <p>&quot;We kept=
 catching them in lies, but they just kept going,&quot; Shefter said. &quot=
;We can laugh about it, but you just know that in this economy, people will=
 fall for this.&quot;</p>              <p>The fact that advanced-fee and bo=
gus-check scams persist demonstrates their alarmingly high success rate.</p=
>              <p>The Federal Trade Commission says scams involving sweepst=
akes and counterfeit checks are among the most commonly reported to the age=
ncy.</p>              <p>&quot;Throw away any offer that asks you to pay fo=
r a prize or a gift,&quot; the FTC advises. &quot;If it's free or a gift, y=
ou shouldn't have to pay for it. Free is free.&quot;</p>              <p>Ch=
ris Irving, a spokesman for Publishers Clearing House, said the company's s=
weepstakes make it a perennial scam component.</p>              <p>&quot;It=
's a huge frustration for us,&quot; he said. &quot;These things do nothing =
but harm us and harm our name.&quot;</p>              <p>Like the FTC, Irvi=
ng said that if strings are attached to collecting a prize, chances are it'=
s a scam. Walk away. Don't look back.</p>              <p>Or do what the Sh=
efters did and string the scammers along for as long as you can. Two can pl=
ay at that game, after all.</p>              <p>--</p>              <p>Davi=

       <body>              <p>Former U.S. Sen. Peter Fitzgerald thinks this=
 is a fabulous time to be a banker, as long as you're the kind of banker wh=
o would have sailed through the Great Depression.</p>              <p>A ver=
y conservative banker, that is.</p>              <p>During his single term =
as the junior senator from Illinois, Fitzgerald was known as something of a=
n anti-politician, averse to compromise even with fellow Republicans. Five =
years after he declined to run again, his seat going to the fast-rising Bar=
ack Obama, state pols still curse his appointment of Patrick &quot;No Relat=
ion&quot; Fitzgerald as the corruption-busting U.S. attorney for the Northe=
rn District of Illinois.</p>              <p>His family had made its fortun=
e in banking, and Fitzgerald now operates a small bank of his own in the Wa=
shington, D.C., suburb of McLean, Va.</p>              <p>His startup could=
 have ended swiftly in disaster. Fitzgerald launched Chain Bridge Bank in t=
he summer of 2007, just in time for the credit crunch, housing bust and rec=
ession that flattened the financial industry.</p>              <p>Yet his t=
iming turned out to be a boon, largely because he adheres to practices that=
 would have held him back in the go-go years, but proved ideal for economic=
 Armageddon.</p>              <p>Fitzgerald believes other bankers should t=
ake note, as should &quot;politicians,&quot; who he mentions in skeptical t=
ones with no hint of recognition that he used to be one.</p>              <=
p>Chain Bridge lends out less than 50 percent of the money it takes in from=
 depositors, way below the norm. At their 2007 peak, U.S. institutions were=
 averaging 113 percent, lending much more than they possessed.</p>         =
     <p>&quot;Two years ago, if you went into a bank and took out money, th=
e bank had to borrow it,&quot; Fitzgerald said in an interview from his off=
ice in Virginia.</p>              <p>After the meltdown, banks set out to s=
lash those loan-to-deposit ratios, which helps explain why credit remains s=
o hard to come by in spite of a massive taxpayer-funded bailout.</p>       =
       <p>As other banks quit on some of their best customers, Fitzgerald h=
appily picked up the loans. But he was even happier to invest the majority =
of his deposits in liquid, marketable securities. Caterpillar bonds paying =
9 percent interest sounded better than IOUs from real estate developers.</p=
>              <p>Besides taking advantage of a favorable investment climat=
e, Fitzgerald also is keeping his eye on the low, low rates for short-term =
money and the rising rates for money lent out over time. As the yield curve=
 grows steeper, profits should come easier, he said.</p>              <p>&q=
uot;If you live to 100, you won't see a yield curve like that. An orangutan=
 could make money in banking.&quot;</p>              <p>Apparently, not jus=
t any orangutan, however. With many of their loans still suspect, community=
 banks continue to command puny valuations and attract little investment, h=
e noted.</p>              <p>Even newer banks like his are no sure thing.</=
p>              <p>Less than three years after its doors opened, Wheatland =
Bank of Naperville is staggering under the weight of bad commercial real es=
tate loans, its current owners and former managers fighting it out in court=
.</p>              <p>For the banking industry and American households, Fit=
zgerald foresees a tough period of balance-sheet restructuring ahead. &quot=
;It could take a very long time,&quot; he warned.</p>              <p>Meanw=
hile, he said, the politicians who keep urging banks to lend and families t=
o spend should be ignored. And for the most part, they will be, he predicte=
d. &quot;The near-depression we just went through scared people to the poin=
t their behavior will change.&quot;</p>              <p>----------</p>     =

           </head>            <body>              <p>Kelsey Steinke thought=
 of herself as a fairly bright college student -- except when it came to ma=
naging personal finances.</p>              <p>&quot;I knew very little,&quo=
t; she said. &quot;Not much at all.&quot;</p>              <p>Compared to s=
ome of her peers, however, she was a downright prodigy. &quot;I mean, there=
 are some girls who don't know how to do laundry,&quot; she said. &quot;If =
they can't do their laundry, how can they handle their finances?&quot;</p> =
             <p>That less-than-kind reality, coupled with a troubled econom=
y that has frightened both novices and experts, has spurred renewed interes=
t in teaching financial literacy to high school and college-age and younger=
 students.</p>              <p>It persuaded Steinke, a sophomore at Chapman=
 University in Orange, to take a class from Union Bank Vice President Pierr=
e Habis, who taught the semester-long class, taking a dollar in pay. It als=
o led the city of Irvine to offer a summer program for high school students=
 on the elements of finance. And more states are including some personal fi=
nance study as a high school graduation requirement.</p>              <p>&q=
uot;I've been a financial literacy advocate for some 16 years, even before =
financial literacy was Google-able,&quot; said Kathy Griffin, founder of Mo=
neyU in Rockville, Md., the online game-based program that Irvine used for =
its summer offering. &quot;I've watched the problem go from bad to worse to=
 even worse in that time.&quot;</p>              <p>Although some high scho=
ols and colleges have offered courses in personal finance-related matters o=
ver the years, &quot;the financial landscape has become a lot more complica=
ted now,&quot; Griffin said. &quot;It's a difficult subject to teach.&quot;=
</p>              <p>She's not suggesting that high school or college stude=
nts need to understand collateralized debt obligations or reverse mortgages=
 to function in society.</p>              <p>But how about the ins and outs=
 of credit card debt? Of taking out a loan? Of opening a savings account?</=
p>              <p>Habis began talking with university officials a year ago=
 about teaching.</p>              <p>Even at the bank, he says, he saw sign=
s that young employees weren't putting two and two together.</p>           =
   <p>As an example, he said people in their 20s left for other jobs for mi=
nimal pay increases largely because they thought the move would help pay of=
f their debts. The better long-term play, he said, would have been to stay =
at the bank.</p>              <p>Still, Habis says he was surprised by the =
gap between what he thought his students would know about finance and what =
they actually knew.</p>              <p>Both he and the students &quot;had =
self-discovery about how much they didn't know,&quot; he said, and slowly w=
orked &quot;through that gap together.&quot;</p>              <p>Steinke sa=
ys the class helped.</p>              <p>&quot;I just wanted to learn how e=
verything works,&quot; she said, noting that a personal loan contract sound=
ed as if it were written in a foreign language. &quot;When I was reading it=
, I had no idea what they were talking about. I was just so confused. I jus=
t wanted straight answers and I couldn't find any. I knew I had to figure i=
t out myself, so I signed up for the class.&quot;</p>              <p>Louis=
 Polak, a sophomore who took Habis' class, thinks he has a leg up on some o=
f his peers. &quot;I was pretty surprised,&quot; he said, &quot;to find tha=
t my roommate just recently started banking and really had no sense of how =
to bank, how to write a check, how to deposit money -- just simple things I=
 thought everyone knew.&quot;</p>              <p>It's not that college stu=
dents don't care. &quot;They just don't really know they're hurting themsel=
ves by not knowing about this,&quot; Polak says. &quot;They're just kind of=
 ignorant on the subject. No one's ever told them what's going to happen to=
 them in the future to give them an idea of how important it is to start ri=
ght away.&quot;</p>              <p>Polak's parents opened a bank account f=
or him when he was young and emphasized the importance of saving money. He =
thinks high school would be a good time to expose students to the rudiments=
 of personal finance.</p>              <p>Amen, says Griffin, noting that o=
nly seven states require some instruction in financial education as a gradu=
ation requirement -- and California isn't one of them.</p>              <p>=
&quot;Young people have access to credit and loans now more than ever,&quot=
; she said, &quot;and it's no good to graduate . . . deep in debt. We need =
a strong, taxpaying middle class; and today's young adult is the next middl=
e class, and we don't want all those folks on the dole and in student loan =
default.&quot;</p>              <p>The sometimes frightening economic news =
of the last two years should have sent everyone a wake-up call, Griffin say=
s. &quot;The worst case happened, and it didn't affect just young people bu=
t their parents as well. Financial literacy across the board is deplorable,=
&quot; she said, but added &quot;it doesn't take financial mastery to be ab=
le to be financially self-sufficient.&quot;</p>              <p>At midsemes=
ter, Habis was frustrated by some students' pace and wished he didn't have =
to worry about grades. He worried that he wasn't getting through to them. W=
hat's important, he says, was that the students acquire the financial knowl=
edge that would help both them and society.</p>              <p>Learning ho=
w to control one's finances, Habis says, contributes to a person's confiden=
ce and self-esteem. &quot;When you're more confident, you're more successfu=
l. That's just how it is,&quot; he said. &quot;And if you feel confident in=
 how you structure your finances, you get motivated by it.&quot;</p>       =
       <p>Polak gets it.</p>              <p>&quot;Even though now I'm most=
ly supported by my parents, eventually I'm going to have to leave that and =
do this stuff on my own,&quot; he said, &quot;which is why I want to gain c=
onfidence in this area before it happens.&quot;</p>              <p>--</p> =

       <body>              <p>The Rev. Canon Diane Jardine Bruce still reme=
mbers the moment 23 years ago when she fell in love with the Episcopal Chur=
ch.</p>              <p>Raised as a devout Roman Catholic, Bruce happened t=
o visit an Episcopal parish in New Mexico, where the mother of a friend was=
 officiating.</p>              <p>Bruce was moved by the joy inside the san=
ctuary and delighted by the sight of the female priest, something prohibite=
d by the Catholic Church. She found unexpected similarities between the two=
 approaches, including the Eucharist.</p>              <p>&quot;There was s=
omething about being in an Episcopal church that felt like I had come home,=
&quot; she said.</p>              <p>Two decades later, Bruce would make hi=
story by becoming the first woman elected suffragan, or assistant bishop, i=
n the 114-year history of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles.</p>        =
      <p>Bruce's ascent at the diocese's annual convention earlier this mon=
th was eclipsed to a large degree by controversy over the election at the s=
ame event of an openly gay priest, the Rev. Canon Mary D. Glasspool of Mary=
land, to a second assistant bishop's post.</p>              <p>But many in =
the Los Angeles diocese speak of Bruce, the longtime rector of St. Clement'=
s by-the-Sea Episcopal Church in San Clemente, in reverential tones.</p>   =
           <p>A banking executive for 17 years before she entered the pries=
thood, Bruce is widely credited with saving her San Clemente church from ec=
onomic ruin. Her banking background has put her in high demand throughout t=
he diocese, with top leaders and church rectors seeking her counsel.</p>   =
           <p>Those who know Bruce, who is married with two adult children,=
 also say she is spiritual, direct and self-effacing, a priest who knows ho=
w to minister to rich and poor alike. She is a cancer survivor who speaks t=
hree languages -- Spanish, Mandarin and Cantonese -- and understands the di=
ocese's multicultural makeup, they say.</p>              <p>&quot;If people=
 looked at who Diane is, they would be absolutely amazed,&quot; said the Rt=
. Rev. J. Jon Bruno, the diocese's primary bishop.</p>              <p>Bruc=
e says she feels no ill will about Glasspool's capturing so much of the spo=
tlight. &quot;It never occurred to me that any attention would be paid to m=
e being the first woman [bishop] because it's been done before&quot; in oth=
er dioceses, she said.</p>              <p>Bruce grew up in Pequannock Town=
ship, N.J., which, as she points out, is perhaps best-known as the birthpla=
ce of New York Yankees star Derek Jeter.</p>              <p>One of five ch=
ildren (she has a twin sister four minutes older), she attended Catholic sc=
hool as a girl, including daily Mass that gave her &quot;a rich sense of pe=
ace.&quot;</p>              <p>Bruce fell into banking at 24, when a friend=
 of her father suggested that she apply for a training program with San Fra=
ncisco's Crocker Bank (later bought by Wells Fargo). She spent the next 17 =
years at Wells, managing various units, including those responsible for int=
ernational banking operations and incentive compensation plans for commerci=
al and corporate officers.</p>              <p>It wasn't until Bruce was 30=
 that she found her way to the Episcopal Church -- on that chance visit to =
the New Mexico parish with her college roommate.</p>              <p>A shor=
t time later, she attended another service by a female priest back home in =
suburban San Francisco. Afterward, she said, she heard a voice. &quot;When =
are you going to stop running and say yes to me?&quot; it asked.</p>       =
       <p>She began taking classes and soon was received into the church.</=
p>              <p>She decided to pursue the ministry, ultimately being ord=
ained to the priesthood in 1998.</p>              <p>When she arrived at St=
. Clement's in San Clemente in 2000, she found a church that was $10,000 in=
 the red and nearly unable to meet payroll.</p>              <p>Members had=
 fled and pledges had dried up as two rectors left in the 1990s amid accusa=
tions of personal or sexual misconduct, according to longtime church member=
s and diocese officials.</p>              <p>Bruce scrutinized contracts fo=
r such things as copy machines, and she looked for bargains on items as see=
mingly insignificant as bathroom soap.</p>              <p>She addressed th=
e financial crunch at Sunday services, telling parishioners at one point th=
at the church could hire a Sunday school director for the monthly interest =
it was paying on $30,000 in bank debt. Within a short time, the church had =
raised the money, according to Bruce and Audrey Daigle, who was the church'=
s senior lay leader at the time and also served on the search committee tha=
t found Bruce.</p>              <p>&quot;We saw in her a very dedicated, fa=
ithful person,&quot; Daigle said.</p>              <p>At the end of Bruce's=
 first year, St. Clement's was operating in the black, Daigle recalled. The=
 church began to grow again, attracting some who had left and newcomers, in=
cluding Spanish-speakers.</p>              <p>Jon and Karin Sherman, who ha=
d drifted from the church, were among those who found renewed commitment. &=
quot;We have gone from distance to involved again,&quot; Jon Sherman said.<=
/p>              <p>During her years as a priest in the diocese, Bruce has =
advised other churches on fundraising, and served on the diocese's investme=
nt trust board and as president of its standing committee of elected lay an=
d clergy members that approves such things as property transactions and can=
didates for ordination to the priesthood.</p>              <p>The Rev. Cano=
n Brad Karelius at the Episcopal Church of the Messiah in Santa Ana, where =
Bruce served as an intern and associate rector, recalled her ability to mov=
e comfortably among different groups.</p>              <p>&quot;She's able =
to speak to very poor immigrants as well as very well-to-do matriarchs,&quo=
t; said Karelius, who nominated Bruce last spring for the assistant bishop =
job. &quot;She can talk to anybody.&quot;</p>              <p>Not long afte=
r Bruce was nominated, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She decided to=
 continue her quest for the job -- six candidates were vying for the two sl=
ots -- even as she underwent chemotherapy, at one point introducing herself=
 in a video to the diocese wearing a head scarf but noting that her doctor =
had given her a clean bill of health.</p>              <p>Bruce's hair was =
stubbly when she appeared at the December convention, but she betrayed no s=
ign of fear over the bout of cancer.</p>              <p>&quot;I've never f=
elt alone,&quot; she said. &quot;No matter what the struggle, I felt God wa=
s walking with me.&quot;</p>              <p>--</p>              <p>duke.he=

      <p>Brinks must be stuffing its armored delivery trucks with Goldman S=
achs' annual bonuses. The company's compensation and benefit pool for 2009 =
is expected to top $20 billion, an average of more than $600,000 for each o=
f the 31,700 company employees whose jobs were saved a year ago by a taxpay=
er bailout. Among the questions raised by this bonanza: What will bankers d=
o with the money?</p>              <p>How to Spend It magazine, published b=
y London's Financial Times, recommends traveling across India by private je=
t, powder skiing in wintry Japan and collecting priceless art. Donations to=
 boutique charities are OK, but investing billions to benefit the public no=
w in need is not on the list of 2010 spending tips.</p>              <p>Pri=
vate gain and community good were not always mutually exclusive.</p>       =
       <p>Here in L.A. a century ago, two pioneer bankers increased their w=
ealth and built the city as it reached for national prominence.</p>        =
      <p>In 1859, Isaias Hellman and his brother Herman immigrated to Calif=
ornia from Bavaria. Profiting from gold-rush spoils, rising industrialism a=
nd laissez-faire economics, they shrewdly assembled the powerful Farmers &a=
mp; Merchants National Bank, with Isaias as president and Herman as vice pr=
esident.</p>              <p>The prosperity of the Hellman bank, like other=
 American businesses, came with a price. Private wealth grew in unregulated=
, polluted cities with open sewers and soot from coal-burning factories. Sh=
oddy buildings and two-room flats were crowded along unpaved streets litter=
ed with garbage and animal carcasses. Streetcar accidents plagued daily com=
mutes.</p>              <p>In grimy Chicago, a model of urban depravity, na=
tion boosters opened an exposition in 1893 to promote American products and=
 technology. More than 27 million men and women, the equivalent of nearly h=
alf of the U.S. population, toured display halls designed in a white, class=
ical style that associated new America with the ancient democracies, Greece=
 and Rome. This architectural Parnassus fired up citizens from Pennsylvania=
 to California to improve their towns with buildings by architects recently=
 trained in antiquity's traditions. In Los Angeles, where social reform was=
 taking root, the Hellmans embraced the national spirit when they razed the=
ir early homes.</p>              <p>As family biographer Frances Dinkelspie=
l recounts, the Hellmans saved money and raised their children modestly. Is=
aias and his wife, Esther, lived in an 1877 villa at Main and 4th streets. =
Herman and Ida Hellman lived nearby, at Spring and 4th streets. At first, t=
he houses were quiet retreats outside the city center, but by 1900 downtown=
 had caught up with the neighborhood.</p>              <p>In 1903, Herman c=
ommitted to Southland growth and built a luxury office block on the site of=
 his one-story cottage. He hired St. Louis architect Alfred Rosenheim, an M=
IT graduate, and ordered the best. Rosenheim came to Los Angeles and design=
ed the Herman W. Hellman building using new steel construction, stained gla=
ss and marble.</p>              <p>At the time, the Hellman brothers were o=
n bad terms, each blaming the other for an employee who embezzled $300,000.=
 When construction costs tilted to a then-unimaginable $1 million, the cons=
ervative Isaias provoked Herman to quit the family bank. He left and became=
 Isaias' competitor as president of the Merchants National Bank. His develo=
pment succeeded and with the buildings that followed made Spring Street the=
 Wall Street of the West in the 1920s.</p>              <p>Isaias was not u=
pstaged by Herman. Worried that the Farmers &amp; Merchants branch at Main =
and Commercial streets was out of the way and that developers would push th=
e city beyond downtown, the older brother sold his home on Main to the bank=
. Its location was prime, with busy hotels across the street and Henry Hunt=
ington's Pacific Electric rail depot in the Italianate style rising two blo=
cks south.</p>              <p>In 1905, a $500,000 Corinthian temple by L.A=
. architects Morgan, Walls &amp; Morgan opened at Main and 4th, its stately=
 exterior, marbled interior and three-story vault manifesting the strength =
of the Farmers &amp; Merchants National Bank. The Isaias W. Hellman office =
building, also designed by the Morgan firm, was built along two sides of th=
e bank.</p>              <p>The Hellman buildings were among the classical =
style museums, churches, city halls, hospitals, railroad terminals, apartme=
nts and post offices that went up across America after the Chicago fair. Ma=
in Street USA, dignified with pediment fronts, granite columns and bronze d=
oor entrances, began to rival the avenues of sophisticated Rome, Paris, Lon=
don and Berlin.</p>              <p>Today, the Hellman offices and bank sti=
ll stand, reconfigured for a 21st century downtown. What does not survive a=
re Hellman-era civic ideals that rallied two bankers to invest their fortun=
es in their adopted city. Think what 31,700 bankers could do today.</p>    =

 <p>One mistake could cost Trina Lee her Christmas.</p>              <p>Thi=
ngs have been tight for the Arizona-based nursing assistant since she got l=
aid off two years ago and suffered some medical problems that have kept her=
 from working full-time.</p>              <p>As a result, she's become meti=
culous about watching her bank balance, which is often uncomfortably close =
to zero.</p>              <p>Earlier this month, she was feeling temporaril=
y flush because she has prepaid most of her bills and figured the rest of h=
er December income from child support and a part-time job could be spent on=
 Christmas gifts.</p>              <p>So she splurged on a $65 meal with he=
r mom and brother, knowing that it was possible that this one meal could ov=
erdraft her checking account.</p>              <p>Debit card transactions l=
ike this one require a signature and usually take a couple of days to clear=
, so Lee monitored every purchase after that, copying her daily bank accoun=
t activity into a computer file each night to make sure she wasn't stepping=
 over the line.</p>              <p>On Dec. 7, the night before her son's c=
hild support payment was due, she breathed a sigh of relief. At 10:45 that =
night, the dinner charge still hadn't posted and wasn't even listed as pend=
ing.</p>              <p>After subtracting every pending payment, she had p=
recisely 16 cents in her checking account. She went to bed imagining that s=
he'd dodged an overdraft because she would get a $156 payment in the mornin=
g.</p>              <p>She got a rude awakening.</p>              <p>Before=
 crediting her account for the child support payment, Chase bank not only p=
ut through the dinner charge, it also &quot;reordered&quot; every one of he=
r pending transactions, turning one potential overdraft into four.</p>     =
         <p>The mounting overdraft charges of $35 each then triggered two a=
dditional overdraft charges for small debit transactions that Lee did that =
day, before she'd realized that her account had gone into the red.</p>     =
         <p>In total, Chase levied $210 in overdraft charges -- $175 more t=
han Lee imagined was possible.</p>              <p>&quot;I accept responsib=
ility for one overdraft,&quot; said Lee, a 29-year-old mother of two. &quot=
;But they created the rest of these. It's really frustrating.&quot;</p>    =
          <p>Bank spokesman Greg Hassell said Chase would not reverse these=
 charges because &quot;Ms. Lee intentionally overdrafted her account, knowi=
ng she had insufficient funds for all her purchases.&quot;</p>             =
 <p>The fact that Chase in effect created five of the six overdrafts by cha=
nging the order of her transactions -- deducting the biggest items first to=
 drain her account faster -- is simply current policy, the spokesman said.<=
/p>              <p>The policy is common among big banks, industry experts =
say.</p>              <p>Bankers justify the policy by saying that it ensur=
es that big, important transactions -- such as mortgage payments -- are pai=
d first and thus have a lower chance of bouncing.</p>              <p>Criti=
cs, however, say that argument doesn't hold water because the banks pay all=
 the transactions regardless. In that case, changing the posting order simp=
ly magnifies the effect of a single mistake by turning a single overdraft i=
nto several, just as it did with Lee.</p>              <p>Indeed, an FDIC s=
tudy completed late last year found that policies like this had caused over=
draft fees to quadruple in just two years, ringing up some $24 billion in r=
evenue for the banking industry in 2008.</p>              <p>Industry consu=
ltant Michael Moebs estimates that overdraft charges have continued to soar=
 and are likely to account for some $38.5 billion in revenues this year, wi=
th roughly 90% of those fees being paid by just 10% of bank customers.</p> =
             <p>Worse, the FDIC study found that most bank customers had no=
 inkling they could suffer an overdraft charge in advance. Why? They'd been=
 automatically enrolled in an overdraft program without their consent or kn=
owledge.</p>              <p>Consequently, millions of bank customers used =
debit cards for small purchases, assuming that the swipe would be rejected =
if they didn't have sufficient funds.</p>              <p>They learned late=
r that, say, a $2 coffee cost $37 because it triggered a $35 overdraft fee =
-- a practice so common that many experts now say using a debit card has be=
come dangerous.</p>              <p>The Federal Reserve announced this year=
 that it will require banks to get advance permission before enrolling cust=
omers in overdraft programs, but the rule doesn't go into effect until July=
.</p>              <p>Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher J. Dodd=
 (D-Conn.) and Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) have also introduced legislati=
on demanding that banks stop this practice of systematically &quot;modifyin=
g posting order&quot; and post transactions chronologically.</p>           =
   <p>The overdraft legislation, which has been temporarily stalled while c=
ongressional leaders work on health reform and other financial regulations,=
 would also require that fees bear some relationship to the cost of process=
ing an overdraft; prohibit enrolling customers in an overdraft program with=
out their consent; and limit the number of overdraft fees a bank could char=
ge to a single consumer in any given month or year.</p>              <p>&qu=
ot;To actively reorder checks to cause a tidal wave of overdrafts is uncons=
cionable,&quot; said Ginna Green, a spokeswoman for the Center for Responsi=
ble Lending, which has been pushing for the legislative fix. &quot;This is =
exactly why we still need legislation.&quot;</p>              <p>In the mea=
ntime, several banks -- including Chase -- have announced they will volunta=
rily revamp their policies.</p>              <p>Chase's new policy, spokesm=
an Hassell said, will eliminate changing posting order -- the crux of Lee's=
 complaint.</p>              <p>It will also reduce the maximum number of o=
verdraft fees the bank would charge in a single day, reducing it to three p=
er customer from six under current policy, and it will eliminate fees for o=
verdrafts of $5 or less.</p>              <p>Any of those changes would hav=
e dramatically helped Lee. Unfortunately, none has been implemented to date=
. The legislation is expected to be voted on early next year. Chase's polic=
ies have an amorphous starting date -- &quot;in the first few months of 201=
0,&quot; according to Hassell.</p>              <p>In the meantime, Lee and=
 consumers like her are out of luck.</p>              <p>--</p>            =

200,000 in a 10-month certificate of deposit at Amcore Bank, which holds 35=
 percent of the Rockford area's deposits. But when the 80-year-old retiree =
got the chance around Thanksgiving, he moved his money to another instituti=
on.</p>              <p>For one thing, the River Forest resident said, he f=
ound a higher interest rate with more flexible withdrawal terms at the othe=
r bank. But the financial woes of Rockford-based Amcore also weighed on him=
.</p>              <p>&quot;I know the money is insured,&quot; said O'Hara.=
 &quot;But if they do go belly up, I want no hassle.&quot;</p>             =
 <p>Parent Amcore Financial Inc., a victim of making too many bad construct=
ion and land-development loans, hasn't reported a quarterly profit since th=
e fourth quarter of 2007. Its stock price had fallen to as low as 36 cents =
a share from more than $20 at the end of 2007.</p>              <p>More pre=
ssing, Amcore could be seized if the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the =
Currency finds its latest capital-raising plan to be unacceptable. Amcore, =
which is looking for about $150 million in capital, declined to reveal deta=
ils of its plan, which it submitted this month.</p>              <p>In the =
interim, Chief Executive William McManaman thinks Amcore might have bought =
some breathing room with the recent sales of $135 million in &quot;non-stra=
tegic&quot; loans for undisclosed terms and four Wisconsin branches for $4 =
million. It also expects to reap a federal income tax refund of between $25=
 million to $30 million.</p>              <p>Thanks to those transactions, =
the bank expects it no longer will be deemed &quot;significantly undercapit=
alized,&quot; McManaman said.</p>              <p>&quot;We're one of the fe=
w banks that have ever reached those lows, and the next quarter come back,&=
quot; said McManaman, who stepped into the top job in February 2008 shortly=
 before Amcore reported an unexpected loss.</p>              <p>On Friday, =
Amcore also announced it agreed with JPMorgan Chase Bank to amend a covenan=
t on a $12.5 million credit facility, sending its shares up almost 48 perce=
nt, to close at $1.02.</p>              <p>At least one fellow banker said =
McManaman is moving Amcore in the right direction.</p>              <p>&quo=
t;Bill is overcoming considerable business challenges in one of the most di=
fficult banking environments our nation has seen,&quot; said Michael O'Rour=
ke, president of Chicago-based Signature Bank.</p>              <p>Still, M=
cManaman said in a recent interview that he isn't sure when Amcore will lea=
rn whether its capital-raising plan is acceptable; a plan submitted in July=
 wasn't rejected until November. He is charging ahead with a strategy that =
includes cutting costs and talking to dozens of firms about pumping capital=
 into the bank.</p>              <p>&quot;The number of interested private-=
equity firms today in this banking industry is enormous,&quot; he said.</p>=
              <p>At stake is a $4.4 billion-asset bank whose roots trace ba=
ck to 1910. Its Seventh Street headquarters looms over downtown Rockford. V=
acant storefronts in its shadows hint at the city's plight. The Rockford ar=
ea's unemployment rate was 15.7 percent in October, the highest among Illin=
ois cities, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>              <=
p>&quot;I've come to realize that, in many respects, we're on our own as a =
city,&quot; Rockford Mayor Larry Morrissey said. &quot;The days of expectin=
g corporations to take care of us are over.&quot;</p>              <p>Morri=
ssey calls Amcore &quot;an outstanding partner&quot; and worries about Amco=
re joining the list of corporate headquarters the city has lost in recent y=
ears. If a bigger bank were to acquire Amcore, Rockford would continue to b=
e a key market for the new owner, the mayor said. Still, when the decision-=
makers at publicly traded companies are uprooted, &quot;you lose a lot of y=
our charitable donors and folks who are instrumental in campaigns.&quot;</p=
>              <p>The local newspaper, the Rockford Register Star, has publ=
ished stories about how the Boone Winnebago (counties) Regional Spelling Be=
e is looking for another sponsor to cover the $6,000 price tag since Amcore=
 ended its sponsorship after eight years, citing a review of charitable spe=
nding. Activities that Amcore still backs include the annual Christmas part=
y for more than 400 students at Kishwaukee Elementary School in the city.</=
p>              <p>Helen Brooks, executive director of Rockford Memorial De=
velopment Foundation, which raises money for the Rockford Health System, sa=
id area business people and citizens hope the bank can weather its current =
challenges because it &quot;has long been an important economic force in ou=
r community&quot; and has supported charities, both financially as well as =
with time and talent.</p>              <p>&quot;It would be rare to find th=
at same level of local knowledge, responsiveness and commitment from a busi=
ness that didn't call Rockford home,&quot; Brooks said.</p>              <p=
>A clerk at a local Holiday Inn notes that virtually everyone in Rockford s=
eems to have worked for the bank at one time or another. What's more, Amcor=
e has made $731 million in loan commitments in the past two years in the Ro=
ckford area.</p>              <p>However, Amcore's companywide employment i=
s down to about 1,000 people from about 1,600 in 2005. A recent round of 11=
6 job cuts claimed its president and executive vice president of commercial=
 banking.</p>              <p>&quot;I was just looking at their Sept. 30 nu=
mbers, and Amcore has a real mountain to climb,&quot; Richard Stiles, the f=
ormer executive vice president, said last week. &quot;But they're great fol=
ks, and I wish them the best,&quot; said Stiles, now working for consulting=
 firm Horizon Advisors.</p>              <p>Michael Iannaccone, managing pa=
rtner for MDI Investments, a financial services advisory firm based in Oak =
Park, said Amcore's prospects &quot;seem to be a little better.&quot;</p>  =
            <p>It still has bad loans to deal with, among other things, but=
 &quot;they won't be taken over,&quot; said investment banker Iannaccone, w=
ho doesn't consider Amcore's branch network &quot;highly desirable&quot; fo=
r strategic buyers.</p>              <p>Amcore has 66 branches and regards =
its core operations to be the Rockford area. It also operates in Wisconsin =
and the Chicago area, where it has 24 branches.</p>              <p>As of S=
ept. 30, Amcore had about $350 million in capital and reserves for potentia=
l loan losses.</p>              <p>But at that same point, Amcore had a Tex=
as ratio, which compares core capital and reserves to foreclosed real estat=
e and seriously delinquent loans, that according to three estimates ranges =
from 157 percent to 219 percent. Anything above 80 is considered a cause fo=
r concern.</p>              <p>Standard deposit insurance is $250,000 per d=
epositor, and Amcore participates in an additional U.S. program offering un=

>Even as major banks scramble to repay billions of dollars in taxpayer aid,=
 President Obama took the nation's top bankers aside Monday and implored th=
em to do more to get people back to work and Main Street vibrant again.</p>=
              <p>On a day when Citigroup Inc. agreed to repay $20 billion i=
n bailout money and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. released details of its plan to r=
eturn the $25 billion it received, Obama told the executives in a White Hou=
se meeting that refunding money paid out at the height of the financial cri=
sis wasn't enough.</p>              <p>In the president's view, taxpayers h=
elped give the Wall Street executives he recently labeled &quot;fat-cat ban=
kers&quot; another nine lives with government bailouts. Now he wants those =
executives not only to return the money but also to make an &quot;extraordi=
nary commitment&quot; to &quot;help rebuild our economy.&quot;</p>         =
     <p>That commitment is to lend more money to small businesses, which lo=
ng have been the nation's engine for job growth -- though some critics ques=
tion the need for more loans.</p>              <p>After the closed-door mee=
ting with executives from Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Bank of America Corp. and=
 nine other large banks, Obama said in public comments that credit was stil=
l too tight where it counted the most.</p>              <p>&quot;Given the =
difficulty businesspeople are having as lending has declined and given the =
exceptional assistance banks received to get them through a difficult time,=
 we expect them to explore every responsible way to help get our economy mo=
ving again,&quot; he said.</p>              <p>Executives said they got the=
 point.</p>              <p>Bank of America pledged to make $5 billion more=
 in loans available to small and medium-sized businesses next year. JPMorga=
n Chase &amp; Co. reiterated an announcement it made last month to increase=
 lending next year by as much as $4 billion. And other bankers also promise=
d to lend more -- within limits.</p>              <p>&quot;Every bank in th=
at room talked about adding many, many small-business originators and setti=
ng very aggressive goals for small-business lending next year,&quot; Richar=
d Davis, chief executive of US Bancorp, said after the meeting.</p>        =
      <p>&quot;Lending is what we do, and so we want to make more loans,&qu=
ot; he said. &quot;We have to find a way to qualify more people and not put=
 ourselves at risk three or four years from now because of actions we took =
at a moment in time.&quot;</p>              <p>The Federal Deposit Insuranc=
e Corp. recently reported that business loans by banks fell $89.1 billion, =
or 6.5%, from July 1 to Sept. 30, compared with the previous quarter.</p>  =
            <p>But pressuring executives at big banks will not solve the pr=
oblem, analysts said.</p>              <p>Most loans to small businesses co=
me from community banks, which also feel increased pressure from regulators=
 to curtail risks. And many creditworthy small businesses aren't seeking lo=
ans because the deep recession has scared away too many customers, they sai=
d.</p>              <p>&quot;A huge part is the demand side, even though Wa=
shington says it's a supply-side problem,&quot; said William Dunkelberg, ch=
ief economist at the National Federation of Independent Business. The group=
's survey of small businesses last month found that getting loans continues=
 to be difficult but about the same as it was in the recovery from the rece=
ssion during the early 1980s.</p>              <p>Overall, 29% of businesse=
s said their borrowing needs over the previous three months had been satisf=
ied, and 10% said they had problems getting the financing they needed. The =
report said that &quot;many potentially good borrowers are simply sitting o=
n the sidelines, waiting for a good reason to make capital outlays and orde=
r inventory and take out the usual loans used to support those activities.&=
quot;</p>              <p>Obama said that though bankers complain that they=
 can't find enough creditworthy risks, he continues to hear from small busi=
nesses that say they are creditworthy but can't get loans.</p>             =
 <p>&quot;My main message in today's meeting was very simple: that America'=
s banks received extraordinary assistance from American taxpayers to rebuil=
d their industry, and now that they're back on their feet, we expect an ext=
raordinary commitment from them to help rebuild our economy,&quot; Obama sa=
id. &quot;That starts with finding ways to help creditworthy small and medi=
um-size businesses get the loans that they need to open their doors, grow t=
heir operations and create new jobs.&quot;</p>              <p>The bankers,=
 three of whom attended by conference call, told him they were hiring more =
employees to work on loans, increasing their target lending and taking a se=
cond look at borrowers that had been rejected. Obama said it &quot;all soun=
ded positive,&quot; but &quot;we expect some results.&quot;</p>            =
  <p>&quot;And so I urged these institutions . . . to go back and take a th=
ird and fourth look about how they are operating when it comes to small-bus=
iness and medium-sized-business lending,&quot; Obama said.</p>             =
 <p>But the president is losing leverage as more of the banks repay their b=
ailout loans.</p>              <p>The meeting came hours after Citigroup an=
nounced it had reached a deal with the Treasury Department to repay $20 bil=
lion in bailout money. The move still will leave the government with equity=
 in the bank but will release it from strict executive compensation rules a=
imed at the seven recipients of &quot;exceptional assistance&quot; from the=
 Troubled Asset Relief Program.</p>              <p>The Treasury Department=
 said it planned to sell its 34% equity stake in Citigroup within a year. I=
t will start with $5 billion worth in conjunction with the bank's offering =
of $17 billion in stock, a step Citigroup is taking to raise the money to r=
epay the government.</p>              <p>Late Monday, Wells Fargo said it h=
ad reached agreement with the Treasury Department to repay $25 billion in T=
ARP money. The San Francisco bank, which has paid $1.4 billion in dividends=
 to the Treasury on the bailout money, plans to sell $10.4 billion in new s=
tock to help pay off its debt.</p>              <p>Wells also plans to rais=
e $1.35 billion more by issuing stock to its benefit plans instead of payin=
g cash bonuses and other cash compensation to employees, and it will sell $=
1.5 billion worth of assets to raise additional funds.</p>              <p>=
Critics have said that banks returning their TARP funds have been motivated=
 more by a desire to avoid government restrictions, especially on lavish ex=
ecutive salaries, than by wanting to make taxpayers whole. BofA, for instan=
ce, has found it hard to find a new chief executive because of pay restrict=
ions that had been imposed on it until the bank repaid its bailout last wee=
k.</p>              <p>With less leverage over banks, Obama has started res=
orting to jawboning.</p>              <p>Asked about Wall Street firms payi=
ng huge bonuses to their executives, Obama said on the CBS news show &quot;=
60 Minutes,&quot; aired Sunday: &quot;I did not run for office to be helpin=
g out a bunch of, you know, fat-cat bankers on Wall Street.&quot;</p>      =
        <p>Bert Ely, an independent banking analyst, said the description s=
macked of demagoguery.</p>              <p>&quot;This bank bashing is getti=
ng almost out of control,&quot; he said. &quot;A lot of the small businesse=
s that are crying for credit are, in many cases, not creditworthy.&quot;</p=
>              <p>Though Obama said he didn't want banks making the same ki=
nd of high-risk loans that got the nation's economy into trouble, regulator=
s, fearing more bank failures, are warning executives not to make loans tha=
t are possibly less risky.</p>              <p>&quot;You have the president=
, in effect, saying go out there and do riskier lending,&quot; Ely said, &q=
uot;and yet the bank examiners are pounding on the banks and criticizing mo=
re of their loans. They're going to respond a lot more to the regulators . =
. . than they are to the president.&quot;</p>              <p>Davis, of US =
Bancorp, said the White House meeting was productive and &quot;very, very s=
erious.&quot;</p>              <p>Obama &quot;didn't call us any names,&quo=
t; Davis said. &quot;It was not a moment when we all went around and celebr=
ated the holidays. We talked about how we can do a better job.&quot;</p>   =

 <body>              <p>The headlong rush by big banks to pay back their TA=
RP bailout loans -- Citigroup is the latest candidate looking for the exit =
-- has prompted a lot of stock-taking about this widely detested $700-billi=
on program.</p>              <p>Among the questions being aired: Has the Tr=
oubled Asset Relief Program worked? Have the taxpayers made a profit on the=
 deal? Did we force loan terms upon those banks on the brink of extinction =
last year that were too steep, or not steep enough?</p>              <p>One=
 question that perhaps isn't being raised enough is this one: Should we let=
 the banks repay the money?</p>              <p>To put it another way, by a=
llowing the banks to exit the emergency program that saved their butts in t=
he fall of 2008, is the government giving up what could have been an effect=
ive tool of leverage over this misbehaving industry?</p>              <p>Af=
ter all, the TARP loans made the government a shareholder in some of the na=
tion's biggest financial institutions. Treasury officials had pledged that =
they wouldn't exercise that power to influence corporate decisions -- which=
 prompts another question: Why not?</p>              <p>And while it's true=
 that the House of Representatives last week passed a plan to significantly=
 tighten financial regulations, it will remain a work in progress until the=
 Senate weighs in. The big banks, mostly restored to their traditional stat=
us as nongovernment entities, are spending heavily -- millions of dollars e=
ach in lobbying expenditures -- to buy themselves seats at the drafting tab=
le.</p>              <p>&quot;We haven't done anything to restructure the i=
ndustry,&quot; says Dean Baker, an economist at the progressive Center for =
Economic and Policy Research in Washington. &quot;Now we're debating a fina=
ncial reform bill, but I wouldn't bet on huge regulatory changes. The indus=
try lobbyists are everywhere.&quot;</p>              <p>Sure, it's a bit fr=
ivolous to ask whether a lender should ever turn down a borrower's offer of=
 full repayment. In each case the repayment has been approved by the bank's=
 federal regulators. Only two of the nation's largest banks, Wells Fargo an=
d Citibank, are still holding loans.</p>              <p>Yet it's not at al=
l clear that the banking industry is safely out of the weeds.</p>          =
    <p>&quot;There's the potential for another shoe to drop in commercial r=
eal estate loans that could involve massive losses,&quot; observes Robert R=
. Bliss, a former Federal Reserve bank economist now teaching at Wake Fores=
t University. &quot;They may be acting hastily.&quot;</p>              <p>I=
ndeed, the banks want out chiefly to escape what they think of as onerous c=
onditions imposed on the loans, such as $500,000 caps on the cash compensat=
ion of their top brass.</p>              <p>As approved by Congress in Octo=
ber 2008 and ultimately administered by the Treasury Department, TARP stave=
d off the apocalypse facing the nation's banking system. The program was or=
iginally set to expire at the end of this year, but Treasury Secretary Timo=
thy F. Geithner is extending it to next October.</p>              <p>The id=
ea was that by injecting billions of dollars of cheap capital into the fina=
ncial system, the government would buy time for the housing market and othe=
r economic sectors to improve, reviving the banks.</p>              <p>It w=
as assumed that the nearly worthless assets on their books, chiefly mortgag=
e-backed securities, would eventually recover some value. Strengthening the=
 banks' balance sheets, meanwhile, would render these toxic assets not so t=
oxic -- a healthy bank being able to survive a dose of poison better than a=
 sick bank.</p>              <p>The implicit bargain was that in return for=
 a government lifeline, the banking industry would get its house in order -=
- placing a lid on excessive pay, knocking off improvidently risky trading,=
 helping strapped homeowners, etc. Almost none of that has happened.</p>   =
           <p>What makes the banks' haste to exit TARP even more unseemly i=
s that while they grouse about the largely toothless constraints on executi=
ve pay, the government deal was extremely generous by almost any measure. T=
he loans carried an initial interest rate of 5%, much lower than what spavi=
ned institutions such as Bank of America and Citigroup would have been able=
 to get anywhere in the universe.</p>              <p>The government, in re=
turn, got warrants convertible into shares in the rescued bank companies. T=
he assumption was that as the banks recovered, the taxpayer would be able t=
o reap some of the windfall, as the warrants would rise in value.</p>      =
        <p>The banks can negotiate to buy those warrants back at fair marke=
t value once they repay the loans. But TARP's Congressional Oversight Panel=
 calculates that in the first few negotiations this year, the government re=
ceived only about two-thirds of that value, depriving taxpayers of about $1=
0 million in gains. (Later deals, such as one with Goldman Sachs for $1 bil=
lion, were better.)</p>              <p>&quot;The public did not take a fai=
r piece of the upside in the institutions that were rescued,&quot; Damon Si=
lvers, a member of the oversight panel, told me last week.</p>             =
 <p>It's hard to dispute that TARP achieved its immediate purpose. The U.S.=
 economy and the financial industry aren't exactly in the pink, but certain=
ly the sense of imminent collapse that prevailed last fall has been purged =
from the system.</p>              <p>But it's hard to find much else to pra=
ise about TARP. The housing market may be stabilizing, but that's because o=
f continuing life support from the government, not the banking industry. Ba=
nk lending remains at a low ebb, though to be fair, the sluggish economy ha=
s sapped demand for bank credit from households and small businesses.</p>  =
            <p>More to the point, there are precious few signs that the ban=
king industry has sworn off the appetite for risk that brought it so low in=
 the first place. Of the big banks, only Goldman Sachs has taken any steps =
to refashion compensation policies so executives addicted to short-term tra=
ding profits get that monkey off their back. Goldman's new policies don't m=
ean its people still won't be grotesquely overpaid, however.</p>           =
   <p>It's unsurprising that TARP never became a fans' favorite. The public=
 hates it because it looks purely like a rich-man's bailout, while the aver=
age strapped taxpayer has been left to twist in the wind. Bankers resent th=
e loan conditions, which they feel are unduly punitive. The administration'=
s diversion of some of the money to help companies such as General Motors a=
nd Chrysler makes it look like a corporate slush fund, which no one likes.<=
/p>              <p>That government officials, bank executives, lawmakers a=
nd taxpayers are all sick of TARP points to the possibility that regulators=
 are allowing the banks to leave it because of politics, not prudence.</p> =
             <p>What was best about TARP was that it placed a congressional=
 stamp on the government's determination to rescue the banking system. Impl=
icitly, this gave the Federal Reserve and Treasury the go-ahead on rescue p=
rograms that may have been even more effective.</p>              <p>What is=
 worst about the rush to repayment is that it suggests that the crisis has =
passed. It hasn't, and the bankers know it. They just want to party like it=
's 2007. TARP teaches us that when they come for a bailout the next time, w=
e should cut ourselves a better deal.</p>              <p>--</p>           =

    <p>Tapping into widespread public anger, the British government Wednesd=
ay unveiled a one-time tax on bankers' bonuses to discourage big year-end r=
ewards and to wrestle back some of the taxpayer money that went into bailin=
g out the financial sector.</p>              <p>Any bonus exceeding 25,000 =
pounds, or about $41,000, will be hit with a 50% levy under the new policy =
announced by Alistair Darling, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer. Darli=
ng told Parliament the tax was only fair because the government injected bi=
llions of pounds into the banking system to help it stay afloat through the=
 global financial crisis.</p>              <p>&quot;There is no bank which =
has not benefited, either directly or indirectly, from this help,&quot; Dar=
ling said. &quot;However, there are some banks who still believe their prio=
rity is to pay substantial bonuses to some already high-paid staff.</p>    =
          <p>&quot;If they insist on paying substantial rewards,&quot; he s=
aid, &quot;I am determined to claw money back for the taxpayer.&quot;</p>  =
            <p>The levy could generate revenue of about $900 million for a =
government swimming in debt. The money would be earmarked for helping peopl=
e find jobs.</p>              <p>As a populist measure, the new tax could h=
elp the ruling Labor Party score points with voters as it heads into an ele=
ction season trailing the opposition Conservatives in every poll.</p>      =
        <p>Bankers' pay is a hot-button issue in Britain, one of the countr=
ies hit hardest by last year's financial meltdown and one of the few large =
economies not to have emerged from the recession.</p>              <p>Unemp=
loyment lines have ballooned, and normally stiff upper lips curl in disgust=
 at the thought of well-heeled bankers awarding themselves generous Christm=
as bonuses after having helped bring the world economy to its knees.</p>   =
           <p>The new levy will not directly penalize individuals. Banks wi=
ll have to pay the 50% tax on all employee bonuses over the 25,000-pound th=
reshold.</p>              <p>Still, negative reaction from financial worker=
s and other critics was swift, with one unnamed senior banker complaining t=
o the Financial Times of &quot;extreme victimization.&quot;</p>            =
  <p>In the last few days, as word of the new tax has been leaked out, bank=
ers have even spoken of taking legal action, arguing that they are being un=
fairly discriminated against as a class.</p>              <p>Critics say th=
e levy could spark an exodus of top talent from British banks to competing =
foreign institutions, or even encourage some banks to pull up stakes from L=
ondon's financial district and head for other centers, such as Zurich, Swit=
zerland.</p>              <p>But the government is counting on the one-time=
 nature of the tax to blunt any urge by banks or bankers to leave.</p>     =
         <p>The opposition Conservatives did not say whether they would end=
orse or oppose the levy. The last time this type of windfall tax was impose=
d on the banking sector was in 1981, under a Conservative government led by=
 Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.</p>              <p>But one party offici=
al suggested that the tax might hurt consumers.</p>              <p>&quot;T=
he real test of this new tax will be whether it curbs bank bonuses instead =
of curbing bank lending,&quot; said George Osborne, the party's spokesman o=
n finance.</p>              <p>--</p>              <p>henry.chu@latimes.com=

            </head>            <body>              <p>Wells Fargo &amp; Co.=
 said Tuesday that it would close 122 California bank branches as a result =
of its takeover of Wachovia Corp. last year, mostly Wachovia offices that a=
re smaller and less prominently located than nearby Wells Fargo branches.</=
p>              <p>The closures are scheduled to occur in April as San Fran=
cisco-based Wells Fargo puts its name on the Wachovia locations in the stat=
e that are to remain open.</p>              <p>A casualty of decaying mortg=
age loans, Wachovia was teetering near collapse in October 2008 when Wells =
Fargo agreed to buy the Charlotte, N.C., company in a deal brokered by the =
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</p>              <p>California was the only=
 state in which the two banks had significantly overlapping retail franchis=
es.</p>              <p>Even after the downsizing, Wells Fargo would have m=
ore than 1,000 branches in California, reflecting how it and Bank of Americ=
a Corp., which has nearly 1,000 California branches, have saturated the Gol=
den State.</p>              <p>In that context, the planned closures don't =
signal a loss of commitment to California by Wells Fargo, said banking anal=
yst Bart Narter of the Celent consulting firm.</p>              <p>&quot;It=
's just doing what makes sense,&quot; Narter said. &quot;When you've got tw=
o branches across the street from each other, it's natural to close one of =
them.&quot;</p>              <p>Wells Fargo currently has 187 Wachovia offi=
ces in California. Of those, 101 will be closed, said bank spokeswoman Jenn=
ifer Langan. The company is also shutting 21 Wells Fargo locations.</p>    =
          <p>All affected employees will be given jobs at other Wells Fargo=
 branches if they want them, Langan said.</p>              <p>&quot;We need=
 all the customer-facing people we can get,&quot; she said.</p>            =
  <p>Employees were told of the branch closures Tuesday, and customers were=
 to be notified later by mail.</p>              <p>Given the amount of over=
lap in the Wells Fargo and Wachovia branch networks in urban areas througho=
ut the state, the closures appear to be on the light side, said Joe Morford=
, a San Francisco analyst who follows Western banks for RBC Capital Markets=
.</p>              <p>&quot;This seems like a prudent, rational move,&quot;=
 Morford said. &quot;I think they could have closed more. It shows how Well=
s Fargo values branches&quot; as a way to establish bonds with customers.</=
p>              <p>One of the Wells Fargo branches to be closed is on Footh=
ill Boulevard in La Canada Flintridge, where customer Mauricio Hernandez, 3=
7, a contract painter, took the news in stride.</p>              <p>Hernand=
ez lives in Palmdale, works in Pasadena and considers the La Canada branch =
the most convenient to use. He won't have to go far, however: A bigger Wach=
ovia branch a few blocks away will become a Wells Fargo office.</p>        =
      <p>&quot;It's easy to come to this branch,&quot; he said, shuffling t=
hrough paperwork in a white SUV in the Wells Fargo parking lot. &quot;I am =
going to talk to my banker to see what is going on.&quot;</p>              =
<p>Hernandez said he switched to Wells Fargo eight months ago from Washingt=
on Mutual Inc., which had been taken over by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. as th=
e banking system appeared at risk of melting down.</p>              <p>The =
WaMu deal made JPMorgan's Chase Bank unit the third-largest retail bank in =
California, with about 720 branches, a spokesman said. Citigroup Inc.'s Cit=
ibank unit is No. 4 with 377 branches, a spokeswoman said.</p>             =

 40 Chicago-area banks as of Sept. 30 had seriously delinquent loans and fo=
reclosed real estate on their books that exceed or come close to their leve=
ls of loan reserves plus core capital, according to Loan Workout Advisers L=
LC.</p>              <p>The number of local banks with real estate-focused =
Texas ratios of at least 80 percent grew to 39 at the end of the third quar=
ter, up from 36 in the second quarter and 29 in the first quarter, said Jus=
tin Barr, managing principal of the Northfield-based bank turnaround consul=
ting firm. Of the 39, three have since failed.</p>              <p>A Texas =
ratio tallies up a bank's severely past-due loans and foreclosed real estat=
e and compares them with the levels of a bank's core capital, typically sha=
reholders' equity, and the money set aside for potential loan losses. A sco=
re of at least 80 percent is considered a cause for concern. A Texas ratio =
puts a bank's asset problems in the context of its capital and reserve leve=
ls, so it's considered a good predictor of difficulties.</p>              <=
p>To lower it, banks need to lower their levels of souring loans, sell the =
real estate they repossessed, raise capital or set aside more reserves for =
potential loan losses.</p>              <p>&quot;The latest Texas ratio dat=
a tells the story of an accelerating crisis in the community banking sector=
 in Chicago,&quot; Barr said. If it continues, it will hurt economic recove=
ry, he said.</p>              <p>Because of Illinois' historically restrict=
ive branch banking laws, Chicago has one of the nation's most competitive b=
anking markets, and therefore its community banking sector traditionally ha=
s been a major lender to small businesses that'll help drive the recovery, =
Barr said. Community banks, however, haven't benefited as much from the U.S=
. Treasury Department's TARP program as bigger banks, he said.</p>         =
     <p>Surviving local banks with high Texas ratios as of Sept. 30 include=
 Builders Bank of Chicago, which has a Texas ratio of 340 percent. The $506=
.4 million-asset bank said the level of nonperforming loans should start dr=
opping significantly in the first quarter of 2010.</p>              <p>Buil=
ders typically lends to condo developers in New York and Los Angeles. But s=
ince the economy began to slump, the lenders to the buyers of those condo u=
nits have enforced stricter rules about closing loans secured by condos. Th=
e lenders typically won't start closing on mortgages of the first buyers in=
 the condominium project until at least half of the units are under contrac=
t, said the 12-year-old bank.</p>              <p>&quot;The projects that h=
ave gone to market in the last couple of months are selling at a nice pace,=
&quot; said Builders President Charles Hall. &quot;They're starting to hit =
that&quot; 50 percent mark.</p>              <p>Others with high Texas rati=
os: Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Chicago, 292 percent; Wheatland Bank, =
252 percent; and Lincoln Park Savings Bank, 250 percent. Citizens and Wheat=
land couldn't be reached, and on Monday Lincoln said it's trying to raise c=
apital.</p>              <p>Family Federal Savings of Illinois had a Texas =
ratio of 245 percent. &quot;We're working with borrowers as best as we can =
to work through the issues,&quot; said Frank Guerino, president of the Cice=
ro-based thrift with $64.5 million in assets. &quot;When we're left with no=
 alternative we're taking properties back and marketing them.&quot;</p>    =
          <p>Benchmark Bank is not included in the list of banks with the h=
ighest Texas ratios because its core capital has been written down to negat=
ive $24 million, and thus the bank's Texas ratio is technically negative, B=
arr said.</p>              <p>----------</p>              <p>byerak@tribune=

<title></title>            </head>            <body>              <p>As Sen=
. Christopher J. Dodd unveiled a sweeping plan last week to overhaul regula=
tion of the banking industry, and as the banking industry complained loudly=
 that this would be a horrible idea, I couldn't help but think of Silver La=
ke resident Jonathan Leahy.</p>              <p>Leahy, 31, had shared with =
me a couple of letters he received recently from Chase Bank regarding his t=
wo different Chase credit cards. Both letters arrived the same day.</p>    =
          <p>One said that &quot;we are pleased to let you know that your r=
evolving credit access . . . has been increased to $10,300&quot; -- a rewar=
d for Leahy being such a good credit risk.</p>              <p>The other le=
tter informed Leahy that &quot;after careful consideration, we have decreas=
ed the credit line on . . . your account to $1,000.&quot; One reason given =
was that he had too little credit available on his other bank cards.</p>   =
           <p>Two cards, same issuer, same cardholder. If big banks had a s=
ense of humor, I'd swear Chase was joking with Leahy.</p>              <p>B=
ut they don't. What banks have is an unfailing instinct to shoot first and =
ask questions later, to give with the left hand while the right hand takes =
away, and to vigorously oppose all manner of parental supervision no matter=
 how big a mess they make.</p>              <p>A Chase spokeswoman declined=
 to speak with me about the mixed messages to Leahy.</p>              <p>Le=
ahy himself wasn't as reticent. &quot;The cynic in me says they're just try=
ing to push me from a card with terms that are more favorable for me to a c=
ard with terms that are more favorable for them,&quot; he said.</p>        =
      <p>&quot;But it could also be that they're just dumb.&quot;</p>      =
        <p>Whatever the reason, this is an industry that would clearly bene=
fit from increased oversight.</p>              <p>Dodd, chairman of the Sen=
ate Banking Committee, introduced legislation that would create a single ba=
nking regulator, relieving the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insu=
rance Corp. of many of their bank-watching responsibilities. It would also =
do away with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office o=
f Thrift Supervision, and absorb all relevant divisions of the Treasury Dep=
artment into a new Financial Institutions Regulatory Administration.</p>   =
           <p>&quot;Our proposal will replace the myriad government agencie=
s that failed to rein in risky schemes with a single, accountable federal b=
anking regulator,&quot; Dodd (D-Conn.) told reporters in Washington.</p>   =
           <p>As he pointed out, this would make the regulatory structure m=
ore efficient and prevent banks from &quot;shopping around&quot; for the mo=
st lenient baby sitter. I buy that.</p>              <p>Like similar legisl=
ation in the House, Dodd's bill would also create a Consumer Financial Prot=

/p>              <p>The American Bankers Assn. wasted no time in depicting =
Dodd's proposal as doing more harm than good.</p>              <p>The bill =
&quot;would tear apart the existing regulatory structure only to create a n=
ew one that would produce conflicts among regulators, undermine the state-c=
hartered banking system and impose extensive new regulatory burdens on thos=
e banks that had nothing to do with creating the financial crisis,&quot; it=
 said.</p>              <p>The association added that it also doesn't like =
the notion of a Consumer Financial Protection Agency.</p>              <p>T=
he unceasing complaints from the banking industry remind me of how my 8-yea=
r-old son starts bellyaching any time I ask him to clean his room. As he ar=
gued the other day, &quot;I'll just mess it up again!&quot;</p>            =
  <p>Happily, the global economy is seldom affected by my son's inability t=
o put his toys away. When banks misbehave, things can get a lot nastier.</p=

p>Citrus Heights resident David Underwood, 75, told me about his Wells Farg=
o Platinum MasterCard. Several years ago, he was informed that the card's 1=
2.5% interest rate would nearly double to 23.25%.</p>              <p>&quot=
;I couldn't understand it,&quot; Underwood said. &quot;I always pay my bill=
s on time and seldom carry a balance.&quot;</p>              <p>He said he =
contacted the bank and was told he could have his rate lowered again, but o=
nly for a year. A year later, he went through the whole rigmarole again.</p=
>              <p>&quot;This didn't seem like the way you should treat a lo=
yal customer,&quot; Underwood said.</p>              <p>As it happens, he's=
 also a Wells Fargo shareholder. So, Underwood said, he attended the bank's=
 annual shareholder meeting in San Francisco this year. He stood up at the =
event and told his story to Chief Executive John Stumpf.</p>              <=
p>&quot;We don't treat our customers that way,&quot; Stumpf reportedly repl=
ied.</p>              <p>Underwood said he was approached afterward by Kevi=
n Rhein, executive vice president of card services and consumer lending, wh=
o told him to get in touch if his rate should ever skyrocket again.</p>    =
          <p>Sure enough, Underwood said he was notified last month that hi=
s rate was about to go up again to 23.25%. So he contacted Rhein's office, =
as instructed, and a bank official called him back the next day.</p>       =
       <p>This time he was told that there was nothing Wells could do to he=
lp him. &quot;They said everyone's cards were going up,&quot; Underwood rec=
alled.</p>              <p>Lisa Westermann, a Wells spokeswoman, acknowledg=
ed that the majority of the bank's cardholders have seen their rates go up =
recently. &quot;It's a different business environment than it was a year ag=
o or a few years ago,&quot; she said.</p>              <p>Be that as it may=
, Underwood has stopped using his Wells Fargo MasterCard. Now he uses a Vis=
a card with a 10% interest rate from a local credit union.</p>             =
 <p>Underwood is no longer a loyal Wells Fargo customer, but he's still a s=
hareholder. And as a shareholder, he's more than a little flummoxed by how =
he was treated.</p>              <p>&quot;It doesn't make any sense to driv=
e away your best customers,&quot; he said.</p>              <p>No, it doesn=
't. But who said this is a business that makes any sense?</p>              =

         </head>            <body>              <p>Sen. Christopher J. Dodd=
 this week joined the generations of dreamers who have called for eliminati=
ng the nation's muddle of banking regulators, arguing that a single agency =
would be more efficient and would end the ability of banks to choose the mo=
st lenient supervisor.</p>              <p>&quot;The financial crisis,&quot=
; Dodd (D-Conn.) said, &quot;exposed a financial regulatory structure that =
was the product of historic accidents, one after another, over the past 80 =
years, created piece by piece over decades, with little thought given to ho=
w it would function as a whole and unable to prevent threats to our economi=
c security.&quot;</p>              <p>But Dodd confronts critics including =
bankers, regulators and fellow legislators who warn that his plan overlooks=
 the strengths of the current patchwork and ignores the potential downsides=
 of consolidation.</p>              <p>Contending that community banks and =
international behemoths need different kinds of oversight, the critics say =
the agencies possess meaningfully different perspectives.</p>              =
<p>Even in 1938, the Federal Reserve described banking regulation as &quot;=
a crazy quilt of conflicting powers and jurisdictions, of overlapping autho=
rities and gaps in authority.&quot;</p>              <p>Since then, at leas=
t 16 measures calling for a single banking regulator have been introduced i=
n Congress.</p>              <p>Currently, four separate federal agencies o=
versee the country's more than 8,000 banks.</p>              <p>Dodd's plan=
 would combine the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office=
 of Thrift Supervision. It also would strip the Fed and the Federal Deposit=
 Insurance Corp. of direct supervisory powers, leaving the Fed to handle mo=
netary policy and the FDIC to clean up failed banks.</p>              <p>Th=
e idea of a single regulator has attracted fierce opposition from community=
 banks, which fear that such an agency would inevitably focus on larger fir=
ms. The FDIC regulates many community banks.</p>              <p>Dodd has s=
ought to address that concern by proposing that community banks be regulate=
d by a special division within the new agency.</p>              <p>Britain,=
 France and Germany, among others, have adopted &quot;some variant of the s=
ingle regulator,&quot; said William K. Black, a former regulator and a Univ=
ersity of Missouri law professor.</p>              <p>&quot;The bad news is=
 that they went to this before the [current] crisis,&quot; he said. &quot;A=
nd to state the obvious, it didn't stop the crisis.&quot;</p>              =

         <p>The proposal by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., is likely to be=
 opposed by the Fed and the three other bank regulatory agencies.</p>      =
        <p>Dodd stressed that his bill is a draft, but said he wanted to pr=
opose something bold rather than start the process by compromising.</p>    =
          <p>&quot;The financial crisis exposed a financial regulatory stru=
cture that was the product of historic accidents, one after another, over t=

given to how it functioned as a whole and unable to prevent threats to our =
economic security,&quot; Dodd said.</p>              <p>Eight Democratic co=
lleagues flanked Dodd as he unveiled the legislation. But the absence of an=
y Republicans was significant, as Dodd has worked for months to try to draw=
 up a bill with bipartisan support.</p>              <p>Parts of Dodd's pla=
n face strong opposition from the banking industry. Edward Yingling, presid=
ent of the American Bankers Association, said a single regulator &quot;woul=
d tear apart the existing regulatory structure&quot; and copy a model that =
failed in Britain during the financial crisis.</p>              <p>Dodd's p=
lan also probably will face pushback from the Fed, Federal Deposit Insuranc=
e Corp., Office of Thrift Supervision and Office of the Comptroller of the =
Currency, which share oversight of the banking system. They already are fig=
hting back against the Obama administration's plan to strip them of consume=
r protection responsibilities by creating a Consumer Financial Protection A=
gency.</p>              <p>Dodd's plan also would create such an agency, wh=
ich would write federal rules on credit cards, mortgages and other types of=
 loans, as well as monitor compliance.</p>              <p>The only regulat=
ory entity that would disappear under both proposals is the Office of Thrif=
t Supervision, whose oversight of savings and loans has been severely criti=
cized. The agency would be merged with the Office of the Comptroller of the=
 Currency.</p>              <p>But Dodd said that merger would not do enoug=
h to eliminate an arcane and convoluted system of bank regulators that lead=
s to gaps in oversight and allows institutions to shop around for the light=
est regulation.</p>              <p>The rest of Dodd's legislation is simil=
ar to the administration proposal and the legislation heading for a vote by=
 the full House. He would give the government the power to seize and disman=
tle large financial firms that pose a risk to the economy, create an Agency=
 for Financial Stability to monitor the system for major risks, and impose =
new regulatory requirements on derivatives and hedge funds.</p>            =
  <p>But Dodd is tougher on the Fed. The administration has proposed giving=
 the Fed the job of regulating large financial companies whose failure coul=
d shake the economy. Dodd would give that power to the new banking agency, =
which would also assume the Fed's oversight of bank holding companies. Comb=
ined with the loss of the authority to write consumer protection rules to t=
he new consumer agency, the Fed essentially would be left with only its mon=
etary policy role.</p>              <p>A Fed spokesman declined to comment.=

head>            <body>              <p>Toppled by loan losses and misstate=
d financial reports, San Francisco's United Commercial Bank was shut down b=
y regulators Friday night and immediately sold to Pasadena's East West Banc=
orp, creating by far the largest U.S. bank focused on the Chinese American =
market.</p>              <p>The combination also will be the largest bank b=
ased in Southern California, surpassing City National Bancorp.</p>         =
     <p>East West agreed to assume all of United Commercial's deposits, so =
no depositors will lose money, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said. Th=
e bank's 63 U.S. branches, including 17 in Southern California, will reopen=
 Saturday as branches of East West Bank.</p>              <p>United Commerc=
ial, a unit of UCBH Holdings Inc., was the fourth-largest bank to fail this=
 year. That position was formerly occupied by California National Bank of L=
os Angeles, which failed last week and was acquired by U.S. Bancorp of Minn=
eapolis.</p>              <p>Regulators also seized on Friday one bank each=
 in Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota and Missouri, bringing to 120 the number o=
f failures this year.</p>              <p>United Commercial's collapse may =
cause a greater-than-usual stir because a year ago the federal government i=
nvested $299 million in bailout funds in the bank in exchange for preferred=
 stock, which was made worthless by the failure.</p>              <p>In add=
ition, the FDIC said the collapse would cost the federal deposit insurance =
fund an estimated $1.4 billion.</p>              <p>East West raised $500 m=
illion in new capital to support the takeover, most of it from mutual funds=
 and other existing shareholders, said Dominic Ng, chairman of the Pasadena=
-based lender.</p>              <p>The privately placed stock sales will en=
able East West to proceed slowly as it integrates the two banks, then have =
plenty of capital later next year to consider additional expansion by addin=
g branches or making more acquisitions.</p>              <p>The takeover wi=
ll greatly expand the reach of East West, which has concentrated on Souther=
n California and the San Francisco Bay Area. In addition to 69 California o=
ffices, East West has full-service branches in Houston and Hong Kong.</p>  =
            <p>United Commercial not only has dozens of branches in Califor=
nia but also has locations in key Chinese American areas, including New Yor=
k, Boston, Seattle, Atlanta and Houston.</p>              <p>What's more, b=
ecause of its 2007 acquisition of a Shanghai bank, United Commercial also h=
as a banking license in China -- a &quot;rare and hard-to-come-by&quot; ass=
et that makes it easier to operate and expand in that country, , said RBC C=
apital Markets analyst Joe Morford. It has full-service offices in Shanghai=
, Hong Kong and Shantou, China.</p>              <p>United Commercial, East=
 West and Cathay General Bancorp of Los Angeles have vied for years to beco=
me the largest of the banks focused on the Chinese American market.</p>    =
          <p>East West, which had $12.5 billion in assets at last report, a=
greed to acquire $10.2 billion of United Commercial's $11.2 billion in asse=
ts. That would put the combined bank, at almost $23 billion in assets, ahea=
d of L.A.-based City National as the largest bank based in Southern Califor=
nia. At last report, City National had $18.4 billion in assets.</p>        =
      <p>The FDIC agreed to absorb most of the expected losses on about $7.=
7 billion of the United Commercial assets acquired by East West.</p>       =
       <p>Like its Chinese American rivals, United Commercial was burned by=
 commercial lending losses, especially loans to developers and home builder=
s during the housing boom. But it also was tainted by a financial scandal t=
hat resulted in a shake-up of its top management.</p>              <p>UCBH =
announced in September that its financial reports could not be trusted beca=
use of the &quot;deliberate and improper actions and omissions of certain b=
ank officers,&quot; who had understated losses in &quot;an apparent desire =
to downplay deteriorating financial conditions.&quot;</p>              <p>T=
he company's longtime chief executive, Thomas S. Wu, resigned in September,=
 along with its chief operating officer.</p>              <p>Ng said he bel=
ieved his new customers would happily accept a takeover by another Californ=
ia-based Chinese American bank rather than an institution &quot;from somewh=
ere else -- New York, or a foreign bank.&quot;</p>              <p>Ng said =
he anticipated only a few branch closures. Some back-office employees will =
be let go, he said.</p>              <p>--</p>              <p>scott.reckar=

<body>              <p>It's not just FDIC-assisted deals for failing banks =
that are getting done these days.</p>              <p>While many growth-min=
ded institutions are awaiting financial incentives from the Federal Deposit=
 Insurance Corp. before they do mergers and acquisitions, 123-year-old Diam=
ond Bank, based at the corner of North Avenue and Clark Street, plans to bu=
y Downers Grove National Bank in a cash deal.</p>              <p>&quot;It =
wasn't a regulator marriage,&quot; said Matt Gambs, chief executive for $28=
5.4 million-asset Diamond.</p>              <p>The purchase price wasn't di=
sclosed. Privately held Downers Grove, founded in 1955, has assets of $266.=
9 million and branches in Downers Grove, Westmont and Woodridge.</p>       =
       <p>Downers Grove lost $349,000 in the first half, compared with a pr=
ofit of $900,000 in the year-ago period. Its percentage of bad loans has ri=
sen to 4.84 percent from 2.34 percent, but as of June 30 it was well capita=
lized by several measures.</p>              <p>&quot;It's a classic suburba=
n bank,&quot; Gambs said of Downers Grove, whose name will be retained. &qu=
ot;It gives us access to the south DuPage market.&quot;</p>              <p=
>Diamond, also privately held, has branches in Chicago, Elmhurst and Schaum=
burg, and is moving a branch to Northbrook from Skokie</p>              <p>=
James Russ, Downers Grove chairman and CEO, said his bank had been looking =
for a buyer, partly as a way to raise capital. It also faced problem loans =
and increases in FDIC insurance premiums.</p>              <p>&quot;We're a=
 closely held community bank with an aging shareholder base,&quot; said Rus=
s, 72, who has been at Downers Grove for 36 years but is still only fifth i=
n seniority.</p>              <p>In the process of going to market and seei=
ng what capital sources might be available, a mutual lawyer introduced Diam=
ond and Downers Grove in early 2009.</p>              <p>&quot;It's a uniqu=
e opportunity for us and for them because we're virtually the same size, an=
d we're both community banks,&quot; said Russ, who plans to stay at the ban=
k. Never mind: On Sept. 14, only days after making its third acquisition of=
 a failed bank this year and its second that month, MB Financial Inc. said =
it was &quot;highly unlikely&quot; to do any more deals until it digested t=
hose. That should be around year-end, the Chicago-based bank said at the ti=
me.</p>              <p>MB has since had an acquisition change of heart.</p=
>              <p>&quot;I believe now, based on how well these acquisitions=
 are proceeding and how well our staff has managed the acquisition and inte=
gration processes, that we could, in the right circumstances with the right=
 target, acquire another company from the FDIC at this time,&quot; CEO Mitc=
h Feiger said in an Oct. 21 conference call.</p>              <p>Comings an=
d goings: Joe Hasten, CEO of struggling ShoreBank, resigned Oct. 31 from th=
e Chicago-based bank after less than three years in the job.</p>           =

ody>              <p>Swiss banker Bradley Birkenfeld would do just about an=
ything for the wealthy Americans who entrusted him with millions of dollars=
 they wanted to hide from the Internal Revenue Service.</p>              <p=
>He'd help them set up phony companies to conceal their deposits. He'd give=
 them credit cards to access their hidden cash. On one occasion, he convert=
ed a U.S. client's money into diamonds, then smuggled the gems across the A=
tlantic in a toothpaste tube.</p>              <p>Those actions, detailed b=
y Birkenfeld in court documents, were part of a coordinated -- and illegal =
-- effort by his employer at the time, Swiss banking giant UBS, to help wea=
lthy U.S. clients evade taxes. The scheme began unwinding in 2007 and reach=
ed a milestone this month when the IRS concluded an amnesty program in whic=
h more than 7,500 Americans voluntarily disclosed their overseas accounts.<=
/p>              <p>Birkenfeld, 44, was at the center of a U.S. government =
crackdown that has all but eliminated the ability of Americans to conceal t=
heir wealth in offshore banks. A U.S. citizen, bachelor and the son of a Bo=
ston-area neurosurgeon, Birkenfeld spent 15 years working for banks in Swit=
zerland, making a cozy living for himself and tax-free profits for his clie=
nts.</p>              <p>An avid skier, he owned a $1-million home in Zerma=
tt, Switzerland, at the foot of the Matterhorn. He kept an apartment in Gen=
eva, drove a luxury BMW and traveled throughout the world, according to int=
erviews and court records.</p>              <p>When friends visited from th=
e United States, Birkenfeld arranged large dinner parties at his favorite G=
eneva restaurants.</p>              <p>&quot;Brad knew hundreds and hundred=
s of people all over the world,&quot; said David Schwedel, a Miami business=
man who has known Birkenfeld for 15 years. &quot;He's a great marketing guy=
, a good relationship guy. But isn't that the role of a private banker? The=
ir job is to network. He was the ultimate networker.&quot;</p>             =
 <p>Birkenfeld was one of about 60 bankers that UBS sent from offices in Ge=
neva, Zurich and Lugano to the wealthiest enclaves of the United States, su=
ch as Newport Beach, Miami Beach and Manhattan.</p>              <p>To woo =
clients, the bank sponsored an array of events -- including art exhibits, t=
ennis tournaments and sailing regattas -- at which Birkenfeld and other UBS=
 bankers could rub elbows with wealthy Americans who might be looking for a=
 place to stash their money, according to documents filed in federal court =
in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.</p>              <p>These Swiss-based bankers were=
 not licensed to provide investment advice in the United States, so UBS ins=
tructed them to take precautions to avoid detection by U.S. regulatory auth=
orities. It told them to falsely state on Customs forms that they were trav=
eling to the United States for pleasure, not business, according to the cou=
rt documents.</p>              <p>The bankers used encrypted laptops, numbe=
red accounts and sham offshore corporations to conceal the names of their w=
ealthy U.S. clients, federal prosecutors have alleged.</p>              <p>=
Birkenfeld has acknowledged that he told his U.S. customers how to avoid IR=
S detection. He told them to keep cash and jewelry in Swiss safety deposit =
boxes. If the U.S. clients needed to make a withdrawal by check, they were =
told to report the proceeds as loans from UBS. All paper banking records we=
re to be destroyed.</p>              <p>Court documents from a series of re=
cent cases identified steps that other Swiss bankers took on behalf of thei=
r clients. One unidentified UBS banker paid a $45,000 bribe to a Swiss gove=
rnment official to learn whether his U.S. client was under investigation. I=
n another case, a Swiss banker sent his father to the United States to hand=
-deliver $5,000 cash to a client at John F. Kennedy International Airport i=
n New York, according to court documents.</p>              <p>One key to Bi=
rkenfeld's success was his relationship with Igor Olenicoff, a billionaire =
Newport Beach real estate developer.</p>              <p>A Russian immigran=
t and member of the Forbes 400 list of America's most wealthy, Olenicoff ma=
de a fortune through his company, Olen Properties Corp., which operates apa=
rtment developments in Las Vegas and Florida and office parks in Orange Cou=
nty.</p>              <p>In 2001, Olenicoff traveled to Geneva and met with=
 Birkenfeld to discuss transferring some of his wealth to UBS. In the month=
s that followed, Olenicoff moved about $200 million to UBS, money he could =
access in the United States through credit cards that Birkenfeld provided h=
im. The scheme helped Olenicoff avoid paying $7.3 million in taxes, prosecu=
tors said.</p>              <p>Birkenfeld's relationship with the Swiss ban=
king giant soured in 2005, four years after he joined the bank. The trouble=
 started, Birkenfeld said, when he learned that UBS' secret dealings with U=
.S. customers violated an agreement the bank had reached with the IRS.</p> =
             <p>He resigned in October 2005, saying he was concerned the ba=
nk was violating U.S. law. A few months later, UBS informed Birkenfeld that=
 it was not paying him a bonus he thought he had earned while employed by t=
he bank.</p>              <p>In 2007, Birkenfeld went to Washington and tol=
d Justice Department officials something that had been suspected for years:=
 UBS' private bank in Switzerland had helped Americans hide billions of dol=
lars from the IRS. All told, prosecutors would later allege, UBS' private b=
ank had $20 billion in deposits from U.S. clients.</p>              <p>The =
meeting spurred a massive criminal investigation that so far has led to the=
 criminal prosecutions of UBS, three of its sales agents, a Swiss lawyer an=
d seven U.S. citizens.</p>              <p>Among those prosecuted was Oleni=
coff, who pleaded guilty to filing a false tax return, was sentenced to pro=
bation and community service and agreed to pay $52 million in back taxes an=
d penalties. An additional 150 people are already under criminal investigat=
ion, federal prosecutors recently disclosed.</p>              <p>The UBS ca=
se has shaken banking worldwide. To avoid prosecution, UBS agreed to pay a =
$780-million fine to the United States and to disclose the names of 4,450 o=
f its U.S. clients. The announcement prompted thousands of Americans to vol=
untarily disclose their overseas accounts to the IRS.</p>              <p>T=
he amnesty applications involved accounts held in 70 countries on every con=
tinent except Antarctica and prompted new concern about tax havens worldwid=
e. Besides traditional hide-outs such as Switzerland, the Bahamas and Austr=
ia, Americans have broadened their search for secrecy to banks in Central A=
merica and Asia, the IRS says.</p>              <p>Birkenfeld, whose action=
s have dramatically changed the world of offshore banking, has declined int=
erview requests. At a court hearing this year, he said he simply followed h=
is employer's instructions in landing clients like Olenicoff.</p>          =
    <p>&quot;UBS recruited me and trained me, as well as my colleagues, and=
 pressured and incentivized us financially to do this business without advi=
sing us of the consequences,&quot; he said.</p>              <p>Judgment da=
y for Birkenfeld came in August, when he stood before a federal judge in Fl=
orida on tax evasion charges. He was sentenced to more than three years in =
prison. But Birkenfeld's day in court did not go without thanks from the Un=
ited States.</p>              <p>&quot;Without Mr. Birkenfeld walking into =
the door of the Department of Justice in the summer of 2007,&quot; Assistan=
t U.S. Atty. Kevin Downing said, &quot;I doubt as of today this massive fra=
ud scheme would have been discovered by the U.S. government.&quot;</p>     =
         <p>These days, Birkenfeld spends his time at his brother's Boston =
condominium, an electronic monitor strapped to his ankle. He is scheduled t=
o begin serving his prison sentence in January.</p>              <p>Schwede=
l, the Miami businessman, said he believes the U.S. government has mistreat=
ed Birkenfeld.</p>              <p>&quot;Without Bradley Birkenfeld, they w=
ould have had nothing. None of this would have happened,&quot; Schwedel sai=
d. &quot;Meanwhile, everybody else gets set free and he gets to go to priso=
n.&quot;</p>              <p>--</p>              <p>stuart.pfeifer@latimes.=

<body>              <p>In the same way that the government took an extraord=
inary step to save the domestic auto industry by becoming a shareholder in =
General Motors Corp., the Federal Reserve on Thursday moved to exert greate=
r oversight of the financial system by proposing that it review the bonuses=
 and other incentives given to executives at thousands of banks.</p>       =
       <p>The goal is to prevent the kinds of pay practices that encouraged=
 bankers to pursue risky, shorter-term deals that came with a big payoff fo=
r them. In hindsight, those kinds of deals were recognized as having contri=
buted to the financial crisis and subsequent recession.</p>              <p=
>The announcement by the Fed was made on the same day that the Obama admini=
stration's pay czar spelled out new restrictions on compensation at the sev=
en companies that received huge federal bailouts. The rules would, for the =
first time, directly dictate compensation for the highest-paid employees at=
 some of America's most well-known companies.</p>              <p>In moving=
 so dramatically on executive pay, President Barack Obama and the Fed are t=
aking on a politically charged issue at a sensitive moment. On the one hand=
, there is palpable public anger at the way executives enriched themselves =
doing deals now seen as reckless. On the other, the government of the world=
's most powerful capitalist society is attempting to put new controls on a =
deeply personal symbol: the paycheck.</p>              <p>&quot;Compensatio=
n practices at some banking organizations have led to misaligned incentives=
 and excessive risk taking, contributing to bank losses and financial insta=
bility,&quot; said Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. &quot;The Federal=
 Reserve is working to ensure that compensation packages appropriately tie =
rewards to longer-term performance and do not create undue risk for the fir=
m or the financial system.&quot;</p>              <p>Many banks, particular=
ly those that are healthy, were certain to be unhappy with the Fed rules, w=
orried that the government was reaching too far into the private sector, an=
d that talent would drain away to other industries where the marketplace se=
ts salaries and bonuses.</p>              <p>&quot;If they're trying to reg=
ulate the salaries and bonuses of most bankers, I'd say, 'Keep your nose ou=
t of our business,'&quot; said William Gooch, chairman of Community Bank of=
 Elmhurst. &quot;But if you've accepted ( government money) and you're part=
ially owned by the government, it has every right to do that.&quot; The Elm=
hurst bank has sought no such aid.</p>              <p>The Obama administra=
tion came out forcefully in favor of compensation oversight, with the pay c=
zar, the Treasury Department's Kenneth Feinberg, encouraging Wall Street to=
 voluntarily follow his lead and structure its pay to reduce risk-taking, t=
hough he acknowledged he could not force them.</p>              <p>Obama pr=
aised the work done by Feinberg, while also saying that in America, &quot;w=
e don't disparage wealth.&quot;</p>              <p>&quot;We believe in suc=
cess,&quot; Obama said. &quot;But it does offend our values when executives=
 of big financial firms, firms that are struggling, pay themselves huge bon=
uses, even as they continue to rely on taxpayer assistance to stay afloat.&=
quot;</p>              <p>Feinberg released his rulings on the pay packages=
 for the five senior executives and 20 highest-paid employees at the compan=
ies receiving &quot;exceptional government assistance.&quot; They are Ameri=
can International Group, Citigroup, Bank of America, General Motors, Chrysl=
er and the automakers' financing arms, GMAC and Chrysler Financial.</p>    =
          <p>The Fed's broader compensation proposal would cover pay polici=
es for all employees who &quot;have the ability to materially affect the ri=
sk profile&quot; of a bank. The rules, which would go into effect after a 3=
0-day comment period, would apply to the approximately 6,000 banks the Fede=
ral Reserve supervises and would be tailored to individual banks.</p>      =
        <p>The Fed is not setting any dollar limits on compensation practic=
es. Its review would focus on getting banks to balance compensation practic=
es to reduce risk-taking. If the Fed finds pay practices encourage too much=
 risky behavior, the Fed could require the bank to correct them.</p>       =
       <p>As an example of incentives that encourage risk, a senior Fed off=
icial pointed to bonuses based on writing a lot of loans or generating a la=
rge amount of trading revenues, without taking into account the riskiness o=
f the loans or trades.</p>              <p>Under the proposal, the 28 bigge=
st banks would develop their own plans to make sure compensation doesn't sp=
ur undue risk taking. If the Fed approves, the plan would be adopted, and b=
ank supervisors would monitor compliance. At smaller banks, where compensat=
ion is typically less, Fed supervisors will conduct reviews, but the banks =
don't have to submit plans.</p>              <p>&quot;Having the Fed review=
 compensation plans as part of their routine exams makes sense,&quot; said =
James Giancola, former chief executive of Melrose Park-based Midwest Banc H=
oldings Inc.</p>              <p>In late 2008, the $3.6 billion-asset paren=
t of Midwest Bank received about $85 million from the Troubled Asset Relief=
 Program, becoming one of the nation's first community banks to participate=
 in the Treasury Department initiative that invests in banks with the hope =
of boosting capital levels and easing lending.</p>              <p>But &quo=
t;having hard caps and formulas virtually ensures that there will be a tale=
nt drain from TARP banks, resulting in the loss of billions of TARP dollars=
 to save millions of compensation dollars in the affected institutions,&quo=
t; Giancola said. &quot;The other concern is that none of these new rules w=
ere part of the TARP initially, and changing the rules of the game after th=
e money has been accepted sets a dangerous precedent.&quot;</p>            =

according to an agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.</p>    =
          <p>BOI Financial Corp . and its $246.7 million-asset Bank of Illi=
nois unit must submit a plan to strengthen the bank board's oversight of ma=
nagement and hire an independent third party to review the loan portfolio. =
It's also required to come up with a strategy to maintain sufficient capita=
l and to restrict the payments of dividends and interest on trust preferred=
 securities.</p>              <p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . three=
 years ago held hearings into whether Wal-Mart should receive a limited ban=
k charter. Some painted doomsday scenarios at the prospect of the smiley-fa=
ce retailer expanding into the lending business.</p>              <p>&quot;=
The failure of Wal-Mart would pose an enormous systemic risk to the FDIC in=
surance fund,&quot; Larry Maschhoff, Bank of Illinois president, testified =

        </head>            <body>              <p>Despite signs of economic=
 improvement, banks continue to fail at a brisk pace, forcing regulators to=
 scramble to keep the industry-financed deposit insurance fund from running=
 out of cash.</p>              <p>With the fund technically falling into th=
e red today, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. proposed Tuesday to requir=
e banks this year to prepay $45 billion, or more than three years' worth, o=
f insurance premiums.</p>              <p>The move would allow the FDIC to =
avoid drawing on a $500-billion line of credit the agency has with the Trea=
sury Department.</p>              <p>&quot;It's clear that the American peo=
ple would prefer to see an end to policies that look to the federal balance=
 sheet as a remedy for every problem,&quot; said FDIC chief Sheila C. Bair.=
 &quot;In choosing this path, it should be clear to the public that the ind=
ustry will not simply tap the shoulder of the increasingly weary taxpayer.&=
quot;</p>              <p>Insured bank deposits continue to be &quot;100% s=
afe,&quot; Bair emphasized, and analysts agreed.</p>              <p>Kevin =
Petrasic, a former special counsel at the Office of Thrift Supervision, des=
cribed the FDIC's decision, which is open for public comment for 30 days, &=
quot;as the least objectionable of some not particularly good options.&quot=
;</p>              <p>Borrowing from the Treasury &quot;would be viewed as =
yet another taxpayer bailout of the banking industry,&quot; he said.</p>   =
           <p>The deposit insurance fund, which insures accounts up to $250=
,000 in case a bank fails, is financed by premiums paid by financial instit=
utions. But the fund has dropped below its mandated level as it has covered=
 losses at 95 failed banks so far this year.</p>              <p>At the end=
 of June, the fund had $45.2 billion, its lowest level since the end of the=
 savings and loan crisis in 1993. The agency's staff said the fund would ha=
ve a negative balance as of today, after subtracting $32 billion set aside =
as of June 30 to cover losses at banks expected to fail over the following =
year.</p>              <p>Meanwhile, the cost of bank failures stemming fro=
m the financial crisis and the recession has been running higher than expec=
ted. The agency now projects that bank failures through 2013 will cost $100=
 billion, up sharply from the $70 billion projected in May.</p>            =
  <p>As a result, without the proposed accelerated premium payments by bank=
s, the FDIC says the fund will run out of cash in the first three months of=
 next year, left only with troubled assets it cannot easily sell.</p>      =
        <p>The FDIC seizes assets of failed banks and sells them to offset =
losses to the fund. But many of those assets are troubled loans.</p>       =
       <p>The agency could raise more money for the fund by increasing the =
premiums that banks pay. But it has already done that once this year, and r=
egulators are concerned another increase would hurt financial institutions'=
 balance sheets. Banking groups agreed.</p>              <p>&quot;Another s=
pecial assessment would likely do more harm than good, as it would directly=
 reduce bank income, hinder capital growth and make lending much more diffi=
cult,&quot; said James Chessen, chief economist at the American Bankers Ass=
n., who noted banks would pay almost $17 billion into the fund in assessmen=
ts this year, including a $5.6-billion increase in the second quarter.</p> =
             <p>So the FDIC board unanimously approved a plan to get an adv=
ance from the banks by having them prepay their premiums for the fourth qua=
rter of this year and for 2010 to 2012.</p>              <p>Surprisingly, m=
ost banks won't have trouble prepaying their premiums, analysts said. That'=
s because they have plenty of cash on hand but have been hesitant to lend i=
t, fearing it won't get repaid as unemployment continues to climb. In addit=
ion, accounting rules mitigate the effect of prepayment on the bank's balan=
ce sheet, spreading out the effect on the bank's earnings and assets.</p>  =
            <p>Independent banking analyst Bert Ely described the prepaymen=
t as &quot;essentially a non-interest-bearing loan&quot; from the banks to =
the FDIC that is &quot;politically more palatable&quot; than tapping the go=
vernment line of credit.</p>              <p>Bair has &quot;stigmatized&quo=
t; the line of credit as a bailout, even though it would be backed by the f=
ailed bank assets held by the agency, Ely said.</p>              <p>The FDI=
C chief said she wanted the industry to solve the problem itself before tur=
ning to taxpayers.</p>              <p>&quot;While we're optimistic on the =
economy, if conditions unexpectedly worsen, we could reach a point when we =
would have to tap our Treasury line&quot; of credit, Bair said. &quot;But t=
oday is not that day. Our analysis suggests that the industry can step up, =
so we're asking that they do so.&quot;</p>              <p>--</p>          =

              <p>Builders Bank is among the Chicago-area banks with the hig=
hest percentage of non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets, a=
t 23 percent, but the Chicago-based bank expects that to drop over the next=
 year.</p>              <p>Builders has no loans in the Chicago area, focus=
ing mostly on condominium lending in certain parts of New York City and Los=
 Angeles.</p>              <p>&quot;The good news is that condo sales in th=
ose markets are, by today's standards, extremely good,&quot; a bank spokesm=
an said.</p>              <p>Most of the projects are either nearly complet=
ed or finished and being sold.</p>              <p>&quot;We're anticipating=
 to resolve most of these non-performing loans over the next six to 12 mont=
hs,&quot; he said.</p>              <p>Builders' philosophy is to finance c=
ondominium projects where condos are &quot;the primary living unit,&quot; o=
r where the majority of people in a section of town reside in condos becaus=
e median single-family home prices are so high.</p>              <p>He comp=
ares it with Chicago's Gold Coast.</p>              <p>&quot;There are peop=
le who can afford $5 million homes, but the vast majority of people who liv=
e in that area live in condominiums,&quot; he said. It's similar to Hollywo=
od, Manhattan and Brooklyn, the spokesman said.</p>              <p>Builder=
s avoided markets such as Nevada. &quot;The bad news is we're all condo in =
a housing crisis,&quot; he said. &quot;The good news is we picked these in-=
fill markets where it's the primary unit, so it's still selling.&quot;</p> =
             <p>* * *</p>              <p>North Side Federal Savings is amo=
ng the Chicago-area institutions with the lowest percentage of reserves set=
 aside for potential bad loans, at 4.53 percent</p>              <p>&quot;W=
e feel the amount of our loan-loss reserves is appropriate for the characte=
ristics of our loan portfolio,&quot; said Walter Hartfelder, president of t=
he 75-year-old institution.</p>              <p>&quot;What the ratios don't=
 look at is loan to value.&quot;</p>              <p>North's handful of non=
-performing loans have low loan-to-value ratios, he said. The lower the loa=
n-to-value ratio, the less likely that a loss will occur, as there is still=
 a substantial amount of equity in the property.</p>              <p>&quot;=
This, coupled with constant communication with the borrowers, has resulted =
in this institution not having a foreclosure nor suffered a loss on a mortg=
age in decades,&quot; Hartfelder said. &quot;Our extremely high capital rat=
ios are indicative of our conservative operations and prudent underwriting.=
&quot;</p>              <p>* * *</p>              <p>Lisle Savings Bank has=
 among the highest percentage of delinquent construction and development lo=
ans among Chicago-area banks.</p>              <p>That category of lending,=
 however, is a relatively small part of the bank's portfolio, accounting fo=
r about $21 million of $399 million in loans.</p>              <p>But 85.7 =
percent of those $21 million in loans is delinquent.</p>              <p>Ch=
ief Executive Jim Renn stressed that his bank still is well capitalized. It=
 has a leverage ratio, for example, of 16.5 percent.</p>              <p>&q=
uot;The construction loans we've made are to the same builders we've been d=
oing business with for, in many instances, 25 to 30 years,&quot; he said.</=
p>              <p>The delinquent loans are all related to new projects for=
 single-family homes.</p>              <p>&quot;It's not commercial or anyt=
hing,&quot; Renn said. &quot;If you're in that line of business, regardless=
 of what price you're in, all those builders are struggling.&quot;</p>     =
         <p>The troubled projects are in such suburbs as Naperville, Plainf=
ield and Sugar Grove.</p>              <p>&quot;They are starting to sell a=
t prices that are below what they were appraised at when we made the loans,=
&quot; he said. &quot;Some of the builders have finished them and renting t=
hem out rather than selling at prices below what they should be.&quot;</p> =
             <p>* * *</p>              <p>At Waukegan Savings Bank, 92.3 pe=
rcent of its construction and development loans are non-performing, althoug=
h such lending accounts for only about $1.1 million of its $74 million in l=
oans.</p>              <p>&quot;Only a small portion of our portfolio is ti=
ed up in that category of lending,&quot; said CEO Anthony Primack.</p>     =
         <p>And the problem stems from one asset: a Wisconsin condominium p=
roject for which Waukegan bought a portion of the loan from another lender.=
</p>              <p>* * *</p>              <p>More than 20 percent of comm=
ercial real estate loans at Northbrook-based CenTrust Bank are non-performi=
ng. The bank was founded in 2006.</p>              <p>&quot;It was in a fas=
t-growth mode in '07 and '08, and deposits were coming in quickly, and star=
t-up banks typically have a faster opportunity to grow with transaction loa=
ns, such as real estate deals, as opposed to longer-term true commercial ba=
nking relationships, where you're calling a customer over and over again an=
d finally get their line of credit,&quot; said CEO John Benson, who joined =
the bank a year ago.</p>              <p>&quot;To grow loans fast, the bank=
 entertained a lot of transactional commercial real estate transactions, pr=
obably at the wrong time. It was too much, too quickly at the wrong time. I=
t was very successful in bringing in a lot of commercial real estate loans =
right before the market turned.&quot;</p>              <p>The problem loans=
 are in the North Shore and western suburbs, he said.</p>              <p>*=
 * *</p>              <p>As of June 30, First Security Trust &amp; Savings =
Bank had one of the worst leverage ratios in the Chicago market.</p>       =
       <p>But, since then, owners have injected additional capital, and as =
of Aug. 5 the Elmwood Park institution is considered &quot;well capitalized=
,&quot; a spokesman said.</p>              <p>----------</p>              <=

      <body>              <p>Corus Bank, which became one of Chicago's larg=
est homegrown financial institutions by betting big on condominium developm=
ent in Sun Belt states, was taken over by federal banking regulators on Fri=
day.</p>              <p>The $7 billion-asset bank is the biggest Illinois =
institution to require government intervention since Continental Illinois i=
n 1984 and the 16th to collapse statewide in 2009.</p>              <p>It's=
 also the 92nd bank, and the fourth-biggest, to fail nationwide this year.<=
/p>              <p>Corus' deposits will be bought by Chicago-based MB Fina=
ncial Bank, its third acquisition of a failed bank this year. Corus' 11 bra=
nches will reopen on their next normally scheduled business day as MB branc=
hes. MB had 70 branches before the Corus deal.</p>              <p>Corus' &=
quot;attractively situated North Side of Chicago branches&quot; will help b=
ridge the gap between MB Financial's strong downtown presence and the north=
ern suburbs, MB said. It also said Corus' River Forest, Wheeling, Calumet C=
ity and Niles locations complement MB's suburban branch network.</p>       =
       <p>The shutdown is expected to cost the Federal Deposit Insurance Co=
rp. about $1.7 billion. That figure represents estimated losses after dispo=
sing of the assets through receivership, an FDIC spokesman said.</p>       =
       <p>MB, which had about $8 billion in assets before the Corus deal, a=
lso agreed to buy about $3 billion of Corus' assets, mainly cash and market=
able securities. The FDIC said it expects to sell most of the rest of Corus=
' assets in the next 30 days in a private placement transaction.</p>       =
       <p>The approximately $2 billion in local deposits are expected to pr=
ovide a great source of funding for MB's commercial banking business.</p>  =
            <p>As of Aug. 31, Corus had total deposits of $6.6 billion. MB =
will assume most of those.</p>              <p>Corus was dragged down by ba=
d condominium loans in such markets as Florida, California and Las Vegas an=
d had said the &quot;housing calamity&quot; was worse than the severe downt=
urn for which it had planned.</p>              <p>In early 2009, banking re=
gulators signaled that they were worried about Corus.</p>              <p>T=
he Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and the U.S. Office of the Comptroller o=
f the Currency put strict operating restrictions on the bank and told it to=
 raise capital.</p>              <p>Although more than 40 Illinois banks ha=
ve received money through the Treasury Department's Troubled Asset Relief P=
rogram, Corus' request to participate was denied.</p>              <p>Corus=
 conceded that finding additional sources of capital on its own during a wo=
rldwide financial crisis would be an uphill struggle, and it was right.</p>=
              <p>In April, Robert Glickman, whose family had until recently=
 owned nearly 45 percent of the publicly traded bank, resigned as chief exe=
cutive. His father, Joseph Glickman, who bought Corus' predecessor bank in =
1966, also stepped down as chairman. The family has been dumping most of it=
s shares in the bank.</p>              <p>As of June 30, 44 percent of its =
assets were non-performing, including seriously delinquent loans or propert=
ies in foreclosure.</p>              <p>For example, of Corus Bank's $997 m=
illion in condominium loan commitments in Miami and southeast Florida, $873=
 million were in non-accrual status as of March 31, meaning they had deteri=
orated to the point where collection of all principal and interest was no l=
onger expected.</p>              <p>Deposits at institutions insured by the=
 FDIC are covered up to at least $250,000 per depositor.</p>              <=

 and developing countries agreed Saturday to curb hefty bankers' bonuses, b=
ut the proposed crackdown on excessive payouts fell short of European deman=
ds because the United States and Britain shied away from imposing a cap.</p=
>              <p>The Group of 20 finance ministers also pledged to maintai=
n stimulus measures such as extra government spending and low interest rate=
s to boost the global economy.</p>              <p>A recovery is under way,=
 they said, but it is far from certain to continue.</p>              <p>&qu=
ot;The financial system is showing signs of repair,&quot; said U.S. Treasur=
y Secretary Timothy Geithner. &quot;Growth is now under way. However, we st=
ill face significant challenges ahead.&quot;</p>              <p>The Intern=
ational Monetary Fund has said that the global economy is beginning a slugg=
ish recovery from its worst recession since World War II and raised its est=
imate for global economic growth in 2010 to 2.5%, from an April projection =
of 1.9%.</p>              <p>But the IMF also downgraded its forecast for t=
his year, saying the world economy would shrink by 1.4%, instead of 1.3%.</=
p>              <p>The G-20 also pushed ahead with plans to reform the fina=
ncial system, including tougher action against tax havens and giving develo=
ping countries a greater say in global governance.</p>              <p>Curt=
ailing bankers' pay and bonuses has been seen as key by some countries that=
 blamed the risk-promoting payment culture for fueling the current financia=
l crisis.</p>              <p>British Treasury chief Alistair Darling said =
that there must be no more cases in which &quot;people are being rewarded f=
or reckless behavior.&quot;</p>              <p>European countries had push=
ed for the G-20, which represents 80% of the world's economic output, to en=
force an official cap on both individual payouts and collective bonus pools=
 at financial institutions.</p>              <p>Britain supported the gener=
al effort to rein in bonuses, but not the cap, while the United States was =
more intent on pushing its proposal for a global accord to force banks to h=
old more capital reserves.</p>              <p>Credit: Associated Press</p>=

 <p>The FBI and the banking industry are advising people to be vigilant whe=
n using ATMs after a recent &quot;card skimming&quot; scam at a Park Ridge =
bank in which thieves attached an electronic device to an ATM in order to l=
oot accounts.</p>              <p>The card skimming has been a problem for =
years, but thieves appear to be getting bolder, said Chicago FBI special ag=
ent Ross Rice.</p>              <p>&quot;It's not specific to any bank or A=
TM machines,&quot; he said.</p>              <p>In late July a card skimmer=
 device was illegally attached to an ATM at the Charter One Bank at 118 Euc=
lid Ave. in Park Ridge and PIN numbers and other private financial informat=
ion was stolen from more than a dozen people who used the ATM, authorities =
said. Some of the customers did not know they were the victim of a crime un=
til well into August.</p>              <p>Typically a card skimmer looks li=
ke part of the ATM, Rice said, and reads data from the magnetic strip on th=
e back of an ATM or debit card and stores it for later use. The thieves als=
o usually place a small video camera near the ATM which records the user en=
tering his or her PIN.</p>              <p>The offenders retrieve the devic=
es and use the information from the skimmer and camera to make duplicate AT=
M cards with which they loot accounts, Rice said.</p>              <p>Thous=
ands of dollars were stolen from the Charter One Bank in Park Ridge, and wh=
ile the FBI is investigating, no arrests have been made, Rice said.</p>    =
          <p>&quot;The people who do this are like bank robbers,&quot; he s=
aid. &quot;Once they start robbing banks, they generally continue until the=
y are apprehended.&quot;</p>              <p>Charter One Bank reimbursed cu=
stomers who were victims of the Park Ridge scam and issued them new ATM car=
ds, said Stacey Sather, senior vice president and director of public affair=
s with Charter One Bank in Chicago.</p>              <p>&quot;It's an indus=
try problem that impacts all banks,&quot; Sather said. &quot;We closely mon=
itor accounts for suspicious activity, and from time to time make the proac=
tive decision to reissue cards to protect customers.&quot;</p>             =
 <p>While customers are not liable for fraudulent transactions, ATM fraud c=
osts the banking industry more than $700 million annually, and that amount =
is rising, said Linda Koch, president and chief executive officer of the Il=
linois Bankers Association.</p>              <p>&quot;Banks are doing every=
thing they can and are vigilant especially when it comes to ATM card fraud,=
&quot; Koch said.</p>              <p>Rice said bank customers should call =
police if they see any suspicious-looking devices on an ATM or cameras moun=
ted near an ATM. The FBI is reviewing security video from the Charter One B=
ank in Park Ridge but said ATM card skimming crimes are often difficult to =
solve, he said.</p>              <p>&quot;Part of the problem is that a lot=
 of times people don't know their card was skimmed until illegal withdrawal=
s are made, and even then they may not know what happened,&quot; Rice said.=

e>            </head>            <body>              <p>All things consider=
ed, Jamie Dimon would rather be seated at Gibsons Steakhouse on Chicago's N=
ear North Side, far from his New York office and the legislative battles of=
 Capitol Hill.</p>              <p>He'd choose an outdoor table and watch t=
he city go by, with a thick hunk of beef on a plate before him. &quot;I mis=
s it terribly,&quot; he said.</p>              <p>Instead, the chief execut=
ive of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. is busy flexing his muscles as President Ob=
ama's favorite Wall Street banker.</p>              <p>This former Chicago =
resident, who still owns a home in the city, said he has been hanging aroun=
d Washington, D.C., much less than media reports suggest. But it would be i=
mpolitic for him to discuss his emergence from the recent economic crisis a=
s the most influential voice in American finance this side of Warren Buffet=
t.</p>              <p>Here's some advice for the wait staff at Gibsons whe=
n he returns: If you want a tip, don't ask Dimon about how the government b=
ailed him out.</p>              <p>&quot;Do you think we were bailed out? A=
bsolutely, positively not,&quot; Dimon insisted in an interview last week.<=
/p>              <p>Don't even hint that the Feds assisted in pushing longt=
ime rivals Bear Stearns &amp; Co. and Washington Mutual Inc. into his arms.=
</p>              <p>&quot;What assistance? Bear Stearns? They didn't assis=
t us. We assisted them. WaMu? They didn't assist us. I think we saved the g=
overnment a lot of money in both cases.&quot;</p>              <p>As for th=
e $25 billion that Dimon's bank collected from the Treasury's Troubled Asse=
t Relief Program in October and paid back with interest in June, it was an =
expensive and unnecessary burden, Dimon said.</p>              <p>&quot;We =
were never in jeopardy as a company. TARP cost us several billion dollars. =
We didn't need it.&quot;</p>              <p>Dimon maintains that he is not=
 ungrateful: Government efforts to rescue the economy over the past year &q=
uot;helped everybody,&quot; he said. &quot;It helped us too.&quot;</p>     =
         <p>He has kind words for former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, =
who in Dimon's view saved the day after Lehman Brothers collapsed.</p>     =
         <p>&quot;He had to break some eggs. Thank God for having Hank Paul=
son in that job at that time. It could have been far worse.&quot;</p>      =
        <p>But didn't Paulson, former chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs, fa=
vor his old firm, one of Dimon's leading competitors, as some critics claim=
?</p>              <p>&quot;Maybe, but I don't know. Personally, do I think=
 so? No. I think he properly saw just how bad it would get,&quot; Dimon sai=
d. &quot;After Lehman, the financial system went into cardiac arrest. He to=
ok a needle full of adrenaline and stuck it into the heart.&quot;</p>      =
        <p>Did it help that several other competitors died on the table? &q=
uot;Not really,&quot; Dimon said, because opportunists like Barclays PLC pi=
cked up the slack.</p>              <p>Chase in July reported a second-quar=
ter profit of $2.7 billion, much better than Wall Street expected, given th=
e recession and financial meltdown.</p>              <p>&quot;They were act=
ually weak,&quot; Dimon said of the earnings. &quot;They should have been f=
ar higher.&quot;</p>              <p>The blunt talk and aggressive style is=
 vintage Dimon. When he went to Bank One Corp. in 2000 after being fired fr=
om Citigroup Inc., he tore apart and rebuilt the underperforming Chicago in=
stitution, selling it four years later to Chase. He then ascended to the to=
p spot there at the end of 2005.</p>              <p>In the corner offices =
of the Big Four surviving U.S. banks -- Chase, Citi, Wells Fargo &amp; Co. =
and Bank of America Corp. -- &quot;Jamie is clearly in the best position,&q=
uot; said veteran industry consultant Bert Ely. &quot;He clearly is most se=
curely in control.&quot;</p>              <p>Dimon famously received a vote=
 of confidence earlier this year from a politician he knew in Chicago.</p> =
             <p>&quot;There are a lot of banks that are actually pretty wel=
l managed, JPMorgan being a good example,&quot; Obama said. &quot;Jamie Dim=
on, the CEO there, I don't think he should be punished for doing a pretty g=
ood job managing an enormous portfolio.&quot;</p>              <p>In years =
to come, Dimon's reputation will depend on how his company performs as it i=
ntegrates the rivals he acquired and adapts to the new order.</p>          =
    <p>So far, he's not satisfied.</p>              <p>The mortgage and cre=
dit card businesses &quot;are very bad, but possibly not going to get any w=
orse,&quot; he said. Mortgage modification, which he has championed, is &qu=
ot;working on a large scale.&quot; Commercial real estate loans will be a d=
isaster, but Chase has little exposure compared with community banks, he no=
ted.</p>              <p>As for new regulation, Dimon's clout in Washington=
 hasn't brought the nation any closer to his dream of a single, unified reg=
ulator for banking. But, characteristically, Dimon said he isn't calling it=
 a day yet: &quot;It may not be over.&quot;</p>              <p>That steak =
at Gibsons will have to wait.</p>              <p>- - -</p>              <p=

ead>            <body>              <p>OneWest Bank of Pasadena, the saving=
s bank that arose from the ashes of failed mortgage giant IndyMac Bancorp, =
reported a solid profit of $182 million for the second quarter, its first f=
ull quarter under ownership by private investors.</p>              <p>The c=
ompany's report to regulators, posted on a government website Tuesday, sugg=
ested that a loss-sharing arrangement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Co=
rp. was helping the thrift work through its giant collection of soured loan=
s and move toward its goal of reshaping itself as a traditional full-servic=
e bank.</p>              <p>&quot;They look incredibly good,&quot; said lon=
gtime banking industry consultant Bert Ely. &quot;I'm surprised.&quot;</p> =
             <p>IndyMac specialized in nontraditional mortgages that could =
not be sold to government-sponsored loan buyers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.=
 In particular, the thrift was the largest generator of loans made without =
fully documenting the borrowers' earnings and assets -- a category of mortg=
age that has produced heavy defaults.</p>              <p>The lender's coll=
apse in July 2008 underscored the severity of the mortgage meltdown, as dep=
ositors who had heard of its troubles lined up to withdraw funds.</p>      =
        <p>The run on deposits occurred too quickly for the FDIC to find an=
other bank to take over the failing institution, forcing the agency to oper=
ate IndyMac for eight months.</p>              <p>The FDIC sold the lender =
in March, agreeing to absorb a large majority of the losses yet to be recor=
ded in IndyMac's loan portfolio. Taking the terms of the sale into account,=
 officials projected that the bank's failure would cost the federal deposit=
 insurance fund nearly $11 billion.</p>              <p>While running the t=
hrift, the FDIC worked aggressively to keep borrowers from losing their hom=
es by easing the terms of their mortgages -- an effort that became the mode=
l for the Obama administration's loan modification program.</p>            =
  <p>OneWest's report to regulators illustrates what many troubled borrower=
s have discovered: Despite modification efforts, many loans are too far gon=
e to be saved. The value of repossessed homes on OneWest's books on June 30=
 totaled $137 million, up from $18 million on March 31, partly reflecting t=
he expiration of moratoriums on foreclosures.</p>              <p>Of the $6=
.6 billion in mortgages in OneWest's portfolio, nearly $2 billion were deli=
nquent or their borrowers had stopped paying entirely. Nevertheless, the ba=
nk's allowances for losses were modest and its profit on par with earnings =
of the best-performing banks in good economic times -- an apparent reflecti=
on of the conditions of the deal with the FDIC, Ely said.</p>              =
<p>A OneWest spokesman said its new owners would have no comment. The priva=
te equity investors, led by Steven Mnuchin of Dune Capital Management in Ne=
w York, include J. Christopher Flowers, who has specialized in purchases of=
 distressed banks, and hedge fund operators George Soros and John Paulson.<=
/p>              <p>The change of name from the tainted IndyMac to OneWest =
had yet to be fully realized Tuesday at a branch just outside Laguna Woods,=
 the giant Orange County retirement community, where the sign on the buildi=
ng still said IndyMac.</p>              <p>Posters in the bank's windows re=
flected the new owners' aspirations, using the name OneWest and touting &qu=
ot;great service and great rates&quot; at &quot;a full service bank that's =
easy to work with.&quot;</p>              <p>But a random check Tuesday mor=
ning revealed no customers in the branch, compared with a dozen each at nea=
rby branches of Bank of America and Chase Bank, nine at Wells Fargo Bank an=
d five each at Union Bank and California Bank &amp; Trust.</p>             =

     <p>For years, Swiss bankers have marketed themselves to the world's su=
per-rich as information black holes. Put your money in a Swiss bank account=
, they whisper, and you can hide it from your government's tax collectors, =
to say nothing about a prying spouse, or ex-spouse, or inconvenient credito=
rs. It's a brilliant marketing tactic. Swiss banks don't necessarily get be=
tter investment returns than banks in other countries, but they do offer on=
e huge competitive advantage: the possibility of secret manipulation of mon=
ey.</p>              <p>A settlement was announced Wednesday between the Sw=
iss bank UBS, the Swiss government and the United States in the Internal Re=
venue Service's lawsuit to learn the names of thousands of American tax che=
ats with secret accounts at UBS. But until the details of the pact are made=
 public, we can't know whether a real dent has been made in Swiss bank secr=
ecy.</p>              <p>Selling bank secrecy has enabled Switzerland to mo=
ve from an impoverished agricultural nation in the 19th century to a rich f=
inancial fortress in the 21st. But the world has paid -- and is paying -- a=
n immense price for Switzerland's success.</p>              <p>Why is it th=
at so many countries, including the U.S., can't collect taxes from large nu=
mbers of cheats? Why is it that petty tyrants can plunder their nations' tr=
easuries with impunity? Or that drug lords can launder their funds without =
fear of discovery? Or that terrorists can move funds around the world so ea=
sily? It's because Swiss bankers -- and their clones in Lichtenstein and ot=
her banking black holes -- refuse to make information about secret accounts=
 available to government investigators.</p>              <p>Of course, the =
Swiss deny it. They claim to be willing -- even eager -- to turn informatio=
n over to foreign law enforcement officials as long as evidence of wrongdoi=
ng by a particular client is presented. But that's the rub. Without access =
to the information in the bank's records, it is usually impossible to find =
out whether wrongdoing is taking place. That's the Catch-22 of Swiss bank s=
ecrecy. That's why Congress finally required American banks and brokerage h=
ouses to report clients' earnings to the IRS. Without such a system, we lea=
rned that huge numbers of taxpayers will ignore their legal duty to report =
the income.</p>              <p>Even after the IRS caught UBS red-handed se=
lling secret Swiss accounts in the United States to hundreds of American ta=
x cheats, UBS refused to provide the names of 52,000 other American deposit=
ors so that the IRS could ensure that they are reporting their earnings.</p=
>              <p>The Swiss government came to the bank's defense. Switzerl=
and told a federal judge in Miami, where the U.S. lawsuit was filed, that i=
t would seize the information rather than allow UBS to comply with an IRS s=
ubpoena. The shabby drama that played out in a Miami federal courtroom made=
 one thing clear: Swiss bankers cannot manufacture bank secrecy on their ow=
n. They need active cooperation from the Swiss government designed to stymi=
e legitimate efforts by other governments to obtain information needed to e=
nforce their laws. Some rogue states export terrorism or drugs; Switzerland=
 exports a virus -- bank secrecy -- that eats away at the fabric of law in =
the rest of the world.</p>              <p>Bank secrecy is Switzerland's mo=
st valuable national asset. Without it, Swiss banks would be forced to comp=
ete on a level playing field. Whenever Swiss bank secrecy is threatened, Sw=
itzerland buys off the challenger. When the European Union complained that =
tax evaders were using Swiss accounts to make a mockery of the income tax, =
the Swiss government agreed to have the banks make minimal lump-sum payment=
s to European tax authorities rather than disclose the names of the deposit=
ors.</p>              <p>It's a bargain-basement way to buy your way out of=
 real tax compliance. When Holocaust survivors complained that Swiss bank s=
ecrecy made it impossible to find thousands of bank accounts of deceased vi=
ctims, Swiss banks settled the case in 1998 for $1.25 billion rather than a=
llow the victims to inspect their books.</p>              <p>The same scena=
rio appears to be unfolding in Miami. The Swiss government has offered to h=
ave UBS maybe turn over a few thousand names when the known facts point to =
tax fraud, but it insists on preserving the general principle that Swiss ba=
nks are not obliged to turn over financial information to foreign governmen=
t investigators in the absence of specific proof of wrongdoing. So far, the=
 U.S. has talked tough, but the proof will be in the details of the settlem=
ent.</p>              <p>A huge amount is at stake. If Swiss bank secrecy c=
an survive this debacle, the message to the tax cheats of the world will be=
 clear: Swiss banks are open for business as usual. If, however, the IRS ha=
ngs tough, an equally important message will go out: Opening a Swiss bank a=
ccount will no longer shield you from legitimate efforts by your government=
 to obtain financial information needed to enforce the tax laws. It just mi=
ght mean one less rogue state.</p>              <p>Credit: Burt Neuborne, a=

  </head>            <body>              <p>Despite the continuing foreclos=
ure crisis, banks have made little progress toward modifying the loans of s=
tressed-out homeowners, drawing fire from advocacy groups who say both fina=
ncial institutions and the federal government should do more.</p>          =
    <p>In its first report on the Obama administration's efforts to prod le=
nders to help as many as 4 million homeowners by reducing their mortgage pa=
yments, the Treasury Department said just 9% of eligible loans had been cha=
nged.</p>              <p>Loans were modified even less often by the two me=
ga-banks that dominate the mortgage market: Wells Fargo &amp; Co. reduced p=
ayments for only 6% of its eligible home loans under the government's progr=
am, and Bank of America Corp. modified just 4%.</p>              <p>The adm=
inistration, under tremendous pressure to help homeowners avoid foreclosure=
, has said that despite the low percentage of loans that had been modified =
under its plan, the program &quot;has made rapid progress in a few short mo=
nths&quot; and was on track to help 3 million to 4 million eligible borrowe=
rs.</p>              <p>But critics say the effort is way behind.</p>      =
        <p>&quot;Congress and the administration need to end their 'pretty =
please' approach to the banks and instead finally force lenders to work to =
keep people in their homes,&quot; said Kevin Stein, associate director of t=
he California Reinvestment Coalition.</p>              <p>Some of the major=
 lenders whose efforts were documented in the report released Tuesday had b=
etter success, such as GMAC and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., which racked up 2=
0% modification rates. Others, including Wells Fargo and BofA, said the rep=
ort didn't reflect their efforts to modify loans outside Obama's Making Hom=
e Affordable program. They also said the workings of the 5-month-old progra=
m were not clarified until last month, forcing lenders to wait until just a=
 couple of weeks ago to adopt it.</p>              <p>&quot;We did 240,000 =
loan modifications in the first seven months of the year, of which just ove=
r 20,000 are [Obama plan] mods,&quot; said Mike Heid, co-president of Wells=
 Fargo Home Mortgage.</p>              <p>BofA modified 150,000 loans durin=
g the first half of the year without going through the Obama program, plus =
28,000 using the government's plan, Barbara Desoer, president of Bank of Am=
erica home loans, said in a statement.</p>              <p>The government h=
as pledged to provide $75 billion in incentive payments to participating bo=
rrowers and mortgage companies.</p>              <p>Under the Obama plan, m=
ore than 400,000 modification offers have been extended and more than 230,0=
00 trial modifications have begun, the Treasury Department reported.</p>   =
           <p>But the number of homeowners in distress is huge. Nearly 2 mi=
llion foreclosure filings were made during the first six months of this yea=
r, ranging from default notices to completed foreclosure sales, according t=
o foreclosure data firm RealtyTrac. There were 3.2 million such filings in =
all of 2008 and 2.2 million in 2007.</p>              <p>Dozens of homeowne=
rs have contacted The Times in recent months, complaining about lenders' sl=
uggishness or outright refusals to modify loans. Some homeowners were behin=
d in their payments; others were keeping up by going through their savings,=
 but facing a looming bankruptcy.</p>              <p>Domingo Delgadillo of=
 Antioch, Calif., started out well able to afford the pay-option Wachovia b=
ank loan on his 3,000-square-foot home. But when his real estate business c=
ollapsed in 2007, he started making only the minimum payments, causing his =
loan balance to balloon as the value of his house dropped. He's paying 60% =
of his gross earnings for the house now and has asked for a modification --=
 to no avail.</p>              <p>&quot;When I called Wachovia in July to r=
equest a loan modification, I was told that they still had not implemented =
their program,&quot; he said. &quot;I do not understand how it is possible.=
&quot;</p>              <p>Reached Tuesday afternoon, a spokeswoman for Wel=
ls Fargo Home Mortgage, which agreed to buy Wachovia last year as it teeter=
ed near collapse, said she couldn't comment on individual customers or acce=
ss Delgadillo's records so late in the day. She said that in some cases, lo=
ans sold to other parties could be modified only if they were in &quot;immi=
nent default.&quot; Delgadillo said he had been told his loan was sold to B=
ank of New York.</p>              <p>The Obama plan is modeled on a program=
 the FDIC developed to modify mortgages at failed IndyMac Federal Bank in P=
asadena. Using incentive payments to lenders and borrowers who agree to loa=
n modifications, it reduces mortgage interest rates and extends the duratio=
n of the loans to 40 years. The idea is to try to reduce first mortgage pay=
ments, taxes and insurance to 31% of a borrower's gross income.</p>        =
      <p>Participants must fully document their earnings and assets, and th=
e first three months of modification is a trial period. If borrowers make t=
hree straight payments on time, showing their willingness and ability to pa=
y, the modification becomes permanent.</p>              <p>Critics say the =
plan needs to be toughened, calling anew for change in federal law to allow=
 bankruptcy judges to order lenders to reduce the principal owed on home mo=
rtgages.</p>              <p>These so-called cramdowns had been supported b=
y President Obama and top officials including Lawrence H. Summers, director=
 of the White House's National Economic Council. But the idea has been repe=
atedly shot down in Congress, in part because the banking industry vehement=
ly opposes it.</p>              <p>Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), chairman of=
 the House Financial Services Committee, has said he would push for cramdow=
ns if lenders did not show they were modifying more mortgages.</p>         =
     <p>But UC Berkeley economist Kenneth Rosen, who supports voluntary but=
 not court-ordered efforts to lower principal amounts for homeowners, said =
the federal efforts to prevent foreclosure might show improvement down the =
line.</p>              <p>&quot;These are early days,&quot; Rosen said. &qu=
ot;The numbers could be quite different six months from now.&quot;</p>     =

        </head>            <body>              <p>Bank of America Corp. has=
 agreed to pay $33 million to settle allegations that it misled shareholder=
s by indicating that Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. would not pay year-end bonuses=
 -- when in fact the bank had already approved up to $5.8 billion in paymen=
ts.</p>              <p>Federal regulators, who brought the suit against Bo=
fA, said the episode occurred as shareholders were considering the bank's p=
roposed acquisition of Merrill Lynch last year.</p>              <p>&quot;A=
s Merrill was on the brink of bankruptcy and posting record losses, Bank of=
 America agreed to allow Merrill to pay its executives billions of dollars =
in bonuses,&quot; David Rosenfeld of the Securities and Exchange Commission=
's New York office said Monday. &quot;Shareholders were not told about this=
 agreement at the time they voted on the merger.&quot;</p>              <p>=
Analysts said the agency's action reflected a new toughness on the part of =
the SEC, which is reacting to public outrage over disclosures that the Wall=
 Street culture of high pay and rich bonuses -- especially at bailed-out in=
stitutions -- was seemingly unaffected by last year's financial crisis.</p>=
              <p>&quot;This was partly a response to what is white-hot publ=
ic anger,&quot; said John Coffee, a Columbia University law professor. &quo=
t;The public is angry about executive compensation at companies that taxpay=
ers have bailed out, and when you have that anger, it could be as much the =
cause of a proceeding like this as the result.&quot;</p>              <p>Ri=
chard Bove, a banking analyst with Rochdale Securities, said the lawsuit wa=
s just one part of &quot;a number of thrusts being made against the banking=
 industry&quot; by regulators and the Obama administration.</p>            =
  <p>Bove isn't cheering the developments. In a note to investors entitled =
&quot;The Government Is Out of Control,&quot; he said the new restrictions =
potentially &quot;will cripple the competitiveness of large banks, forcing =
them to shrink.&quot;</p>              <p>BofA, which has received $45 bill=
ion in bailout funds from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program, n=
either admitted nor denied wrongdoing in making the settlement.</p>        =
      <p>&quot;This is an important step forward for Bank of America and al=
lows us to focus our energies on enhancing stockholder value by continuing =
to execute our strategies for the long-term success of our business,&quot; =
the bank said in a statement.</p>              <p>According to the SEC, Bof=
A told shareholders in a proxy statement accompanying the acquisition that =
the bonuses wouldn't be paid without the bank's consent. But BofA failed to=
 tell investors that it had weeks earlier granted Merrill permission to pay=
 out up to $5.8 billion, the suit said.</p>              <p>Merrill finally=
 paid $3.6 billion in bonuses, even though its $27.6-billion loss last year=
 put it on bankruptcy's doorstep.</p>              <p>&quot;The statements =
create the impression that Bank of America had not given its written consen=
t to the payment of discretionary year-end bonuses at Merrill . . . when in=
 fact by the time the proxy statement was prepared and distributed to share=
holders, Bank of America had already given its written consent,&quot; the s=
uit alleged.</p>              <p>The allotted $5.8 billion in bonuses amoun=
ted to nearly 12% of BofA's $50-billion purchase price.</p>              <p=
>The SEC suit is the latest pothole in Bank of America's star-crossed acqui=
sition of Merrill. Previously, the bank has been at the center of a controv=
ersy over whether top government officials pushed it to withhold key inform=
ation from shareholders last year to complete the Merrill deal and stave of=
f even more dramatic problems in the financial system.</p>              <p>=
Critics, including some in Congress, have questioned whether Federal Reserv=
e Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson f=
orced BofA to follow through on the Merrill transaction, including potentia=
lly misleading shareholders about the depth of Merrill's impending fourth-q=
uarter loss to prevent votes against the deal.</p>              <p>Given th=
e concern about executive compensation, disclosure of the bonuses might hav=
e prompted investors to shoot down the deal, said banking analyst Nancy Bus=
h of NAB Research in Annandale, N.J. &quot;People were up in arms about wha=
t was going on,&quot; Bush said.</p>              <p>Also Monday, Bank of A=
merica Chief Executive Ken Lewis announced that he was shaking up senior ma=
nagement in a series of changes that included the replacement of Liam McGee=
 as head of consumer banking by Brian Moynihan, the current head of investm=
ent banking. Tom Montag succeeded Moynihan. McGee is leaving to pursue a go=
al of running a company, the bank said.</p>              <p>Lewis also hire=
d former Citigroup Inc. executive Sallie Krawcheck, a veteran of a variety =
of senior financial services positions, to run the bank's global wealth and=
 investment management unit. She will be a member of the executive manageme=
nt team.</p>              <p>&quot;These changes also position a number of =
senior executives to compete to succeed me at the appropriate time,&quot; s=
aid Lewis, 62.</p>              <p>--</p>              <p>walter.hamilton@l=

e>            </head>            <body>              <p>A decade ago, big b=
anks and thrifts began closing branches in the belief that clicks would rep=
lace bricks as customers moved their business online.</p>              <p>B=
ut consumers weren't ready, and the experiment was soon abandoned.</p>     =
         <p>Now the old model may finally be changing.</p>              <p>=
Bank of America Corp., a pioneer in banking online and through mobile phone=
s, said Tuesday that it was considering closing up to 10% of its 6,100 offi=
ces across the country, as more customers shift their financial transaction=
s to cyberspace.</p>              <p>The strategy reflects the Charlotte, N=
.C., bank's success in getting customers to use its online services, an eff=
ort that has forced other giants such as Wells Fargo Bank and JPMorgan Chas=
e &amp; Co. to improve their own services, analysts said.</p>              =
<p>While other banks haven't talked about closing branches, some analysts b=
elieve that the industry is approaching a future that will include less rea=
l estate and more wireless. While online banking was initially used mostly =
by younger customers, now it has caught on throughout the population.</p>  =
            <p>Toni Iseman, a 63-year-old Laguna Beach City Council member,=
 uses her Wells Fargo online service to move money among four accounts, pay=
 bills without accidental overdrafts, and quickly tally expenses to enter o=
n her income tax forms.</p>              <p>&quot;I had a car payment that =
somehow didn't reach Toyota, but it was a snap to prove it had left Wells F=
argo,&quot; Iseman said.</p>              <p>Among large banks, Bank of Ame=
rica was the first to offer free bill-paying services, and last year the co=
mpany began allowing customers to chat online with bank representatives 24 =
hours a day. These services made online banking seem safe to mainstream cus=
tomers, said Christopher Musto, the head of the competitive research group =
at Keynote Systems of San Mateo, a mobile and website test and measurement =
service.</p>              <p>&quot;Bank of America was way out ahead,&quot;=
 Musto said. &quot;And now the other banks are catching up.&quot;</p>      =
        <p>It is not clear how fast -- or how far -- Bank of America will g=
o to cut branches. The company, which had already begun paring branches in =
the recession, said this week that it was considering the move but had not =
decided how many locations would be affected. It has 1,000 branches in Cali=
fornia.</p>              <p>It's all part of an effort by the financial gia=
nt to cut costs as it adjusts to changes in how customers conduct banking. =
Use of automated teller machines has risen sharply in recent years along wi=
th online banking. And the last year has seen a huge surge in banking from =
hand-held mobile devices.</p>              <p>&quot;What we are heading to =
is a model where we have fewer but more robust branches that incorporate th=
e investment and mortgage services that we have picked up with the acquisit=
ion of Merrill Lynch and Countrywide,&quot; said James Mahoney, a Bank of A=
merica spokesman, who said the downsizing might take as long as five years.=
</p>              <p>There will be less need for branches, he said, because=
 people are accessing their money in new ways and have less need for the tr=
aditional neighborhood branch.</p>              <p>The company has 29 milli=
on online customers, who conduct more than 3 billion transactions a year.</=
p>              <p>&quot;We have gone from zero to more than 2.8 million mo=
bile [phone] banking customers in less than two years,&quot; he said.</p>  =
            <p>The success is due in part to Bank of America's use of reass=
uring security techniques, such as e-mails and text messages to alert custo=
mers when transactions are made. Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and many other banks=
 also have adopted such measures, soothing customers' fears that identity t=
hefts might go undetected, said Tim Murphy, mobile banking manager at Keyno=
te Systems.</p>              <p>Closing branches would represent a retrench=
ment for Bank of America, which over the last two decades has expanded aggr=
essively, giving it coast-to-coast reach.</p>              <p>Some analysts=
 said closing branches makes strategic sense considering the pressure Bank =
of America is under to shore up its financial position as it struggles to a=
bsorb its controversial purchases of Countrywide Financial Corp. and Merril=
l Lynch &amp; Co. It has received $45 billion in federal bailout money, one=
 of the largest amounts among financial firms.</p>              <p>&quot;Ba=
nk of America has made a lot of acquisitions, and it is time to figure out =
where to cut expenses,&quot; said Jason O'Donnell, an analyst at Boenning &=
amp; Scattergood Inc. in Philadelphia. &quot;Eliminating branch overhead an=
d overlap makes sense.&quot;</p>              <p>Other banks could soon fol=
low, shutting branches, including redundant ones that they acquired in merg=
ers, O'Donnell said.</p>              <p>At Bank of America, he predicted, =
branch closures will be heaviest in areas where real estate and operating e=
xpenses are highest.</p>              <p>Other analysts said they expected =
Bank of America and other banks to go slowly at downsizing.</p>            =
  <p>&quot;Bankers are lemmings, and if one does something that gets some t=
raction, eventually they all follow,&quot; said Joe Morford, who follows Ba=
nk of America for RBC Capital Markets.</p>              <p>He said, though,=
 that he would be surprised by a 10% reduction because branches still serve=
 useful purposes.</p>              <p>&quot;Branches are still very importa=
nt for customer acquisition, and most people still use mobile banking as an=
 addition to their traditional banking patterns,&quot; Morford said.</p>   =
           <p>Bank of America's chief rivals said they weren't planning maj=
or branch closures except as consolidation measures.</p>              <p>Sp=
okesman Tom Kelly said JPMorgan Chase had nearly completed its planned clos=
ure of 400 overlapping branches stemming from its acquisition of Washington=
 Mutual Inc. None of those closures are in California, where Chase Bank had=
 no operations before the WaMu takeover.</p>              <p>In a statement=
, Wells Fargo said: &quot;We continue to see stores as a critical base for =
sales and service. We have no plans to change our strategy.&quot;</p>      =
        <p>Bank of America's analysis of its branch requirements comes at a=
 time when it is being monitored closely by the federal government after gr=
eater-than-expected losses from its purchases of Countrywide last summer an=
d Merrill Lynch in January.</p>              <p>Last week, the bank reporte=
d a profit of $3.22 billion in the April-to-June quarter but continued to s=
truggle with serious problems in its loan portfolio. A year earlier, the co=
mpany earned $3.41 billion.</p>              <p>Bank of America shares gain=

 Northern Trust Corp. chief executive and has been a director of numerous o=

 has generated as much buzz as his appearance in a July 18 photo.</p>      =
        <p>The Chicago Tribune that day ran a picture of an unidentified &q=
uot;fan&quot; at Wrigley Field snapping photos on his Motorola camera phone=
 at the July 16 concert of Elton John and Billy Joel.</p>              <p>T=
he shutterbug: Osborn.</p>              <p>&quot;It's kind of embarrassing,=
&quot; Osborn said last week with a laugh. &quot;I look like a groupie out =
there.&quot;</p>              <p>Osborn, who had been invited to the concer=
t, was sitting about a half-dozen rows from the stage.</p>              <p>=
&quot;Elton John was right in front of me,&quot; Osborn recalled. &quot;Oth=
er people started taking pictures, and I didn't have a camera but then I re=
membered I had a phone.</p>              <p>&quot;The next thing I know, my=
 picture is in the Tribune,&quot; said Osborn, who also is a director of Tr=
ibune Co., parent of the Chicago Tribune.</p>              <p>His name wasn=
't in the photo caption, but many recognized him.</p>              <p>&quot=
;I got more comments on that than I have on anything else,&quot; he noted.<=
/p>              <p>Osborn has seen John and Joel perform before. Osborn al=
so attended the John-Joel concert again a few days later to celebrate a fri=
end's birthday.</p>              <p>So, Chicagoans want to know: Elton or B=
illy?</p>              <p>Diplomatically, he said he likes &quot;them both.=
&quot;</p>              <p>&quot;They're so good on the piano it's unbeliev=
able,&quot; he said.</p>              <p>Osborn said he briefly met John on=
ce when he was introduced to him by his agent, a Northern client.</p>      =
        <p>On July 21 Osborn announced he'll step down as Northern chairman=
 in November after 14 years. He'll also leave the board.</p>              <=
p>&quot;We're finally out of TARP,&quot; Osborn said of the U.S. Treasury D=
epartment's Troubled Asset Relief Program, in which Northern borrowed $1.6 =
billion in November but repaid it last month. &quot;We've been working on t=
he transition, and I stayed around a little longer because of the environme=
nt, but now everything is working out and it's a nice easy time to fade awa=
y.&quot;</p>              <p>Saying goodbye: Carol Hoppe, 89, mother of Col=
e Taylor Bank Chief Executive Mark Hoppe, died July 10 in Baraboo, Wis.</p>=
              <p>Over the years, Hoppe, who earned an education degree from=
 the University of Wisconsin-Madison, had done substitute teaching at a loc=
al Catholic grade school, had a real estate sales company with a daughter, =
and chaired the local parks and recreation board.</p>              <p>She h=
ad five children, 14 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.</p>       =
       <p>She died from complications related to surgery for a tumor.</p>  =
            <p>Her husband died in 2001. The couple helped establish a Cath=
olic parish of St. William's in Naples, Fla., while living there for 17 yea=

           </head>            <body>              <p>One of the most artful=
 property-tax tricks in the history of Illinois -- a sham of near biblical =
proportions -- has finally been exorcised.</p>              <p>This is the =
story of Chicago banker George Michael, who lives in a gorgeous $3 million =
mansion in Lake Bluff. Being a man of logic and finance, he didn't much lik=
e his $80,000 yearly property-tax bill.</p>              <p>So he found an =
Internet outfit called the Church of Spiritual Humanism. According to the c=
hurch's Web site, it's not big on faith, but it's all about reason:</p>    =
          <p>&quot;If you agree that Religion must be based on Reason, you =
can be ordained right now for free, and be still able to practice your own =
religious traditions by simply clicking the button below:</p>              =
<p>&quot;ORDAIN ME.&quot;</p>              <p>And lo, Michael clicked &quot=
;Ordain Me,&quot; and it was done.</p>              <p>Michael submitted ev=
idence to the Illinois Department of Revenue that his mansion wasn't really=
 a mansion. It was a church and therefore exempt from the burden of $80,000=
 a year in property taxes.</p>              <p>Some goofball at the state a=
gency must have agreed because Michael got preliminary tax-exempt status.</=
p>              <p>This was big front-page news in the Tribune last July, a=
nd taxpayers were outraged. Lake Bluff immediately contested the exemption.=
</p>              <p>Finally, in a ruling this month, Kenneth Galvin, an in=
dependent state administrative law judge working for the Department of Reve=
nue, called the whole thing a farce and reversed the exemption.</p>        =
      <p>&quot;One could conclude from the record in this case that the app=
licant's request for an exemption for the residence is a sham,&quot; Galvin=
 wrote in his July 8 order.</p>              <p>Michael's evidence that his=
 mansion was a church included a copy of his snazzy Internet clergy ID card=
, which authorizes him to &quot;perform all duties of the clergy including =
marriages, baby namings, invocations and all manner of religious ceremonies=
.&quot;</p>              <p>He also included a photograph of the home depic=
ting a suspicious-looking cross on the exterior wall of the mansion. The ph=
oto appeared a tad askew.</p>              <p>&quot;This equal-sided cross =
was drawn on the photograph with a marker and did not physically exist at t=
he time the photo was taken,&quot; Galvin wrote in his order.</p>          =
    <p>It's a miracle!</p>              <p>After the alleged sham photo was=
 sent to the state, Michael put a more substantive cross on the wall -- it =
looked like two-by-fours painted black -- and Michael insisted he held serv=
ices for his family on the indoor racquetball court. According to the judge=
's ruling, Michael was asked at his deposition if any strangers had attende=
d his church services.</p>              <p>&quot;He responded, 'Yes,' but h=
e didn't know who the person was,&quot; Galvin wrote. He then quoted Michae=
l as saying, &quot;My brother brought a couple of guys with him.&quot;</p> =
             <p>The Church of a Coupla Guys? Another miracle!</p>          =
    <p>Peter Friedman, village attorney for Lake Bluff, said the town was p=
leased with Galvin's ruling because Michael will now have to pay back taxes=
.</p>              <p>&quot;We are happy with the outcome, but our frustrat=
ion was that it should never have gotten this far in the first place,&quot;=
 Friedman said.</p>              <p>You'd think the Department of Revenue w=
ould be embarrassed after recommending preliminary tax-exempt status, but n=
ot so. Officials defended the process, saying the truth was revealed.</p>  =
            <p>&quot;This is a case of an applicant who presented false inf=
ormation,&quot; said Michael Klemens, manager of policy and communications =
for the department &quot;Through our process, that was determined to be in =
error, and the property is not exempt.&quot;</p>              <p>If they we=
re looking for evidence of religiosity, they could have searched court reco=
rds. Michael's humble nature was revealed in a sexual-harassment case broug=
ht by a young woman who worked at his Citizens Bank &amp; Trust.</p>       =
       <p>According to an opinion issued in 2006 by the 7th Circuit Court o=
f Appeals, the woman testified that Michael made a habit of trying to trap =
her in the bank vault. He'd make &quot;grunting, mumbling, sucking noises .=
.. put his hand on [her] butt and start laughing.&quot;</p>              <p=
>She also testified that he'd say he &quot;wanted to lick [her] like an ice=
 cream cone.&quot;</p>              <p>The appeals court upheld a federal j=
ury's decision ordering Citizens Bank to pay more than $700,000 in damages =
and attorneys fees. But here's my question: Do they have ice cream socials =
at the Church of Spiritual Humanism?</p>              <p>Sadly, not everyon=
e is happy with the property-tax exemption ruling.</p>              <p>&quo=
t;Although surprised and disappointed with the ruling ... the Reverend full=
y believes that this decision will be reversed during the appellate process=
,&quot; said Michael's attorney, Mark Belongia, in an e-mailed statement.</=
p>              <p>Given the history of this state, it wouldn't surprise me=
 if Michael wins his appeal.</p>              <p>If he does, then taxpayers=
 should demand sanctuary at his church, on the racquetball court, lighting =
millions of candles, one for every property-tax-paying, unordained chumbolo=
ne in Illinois.</p>              <p>Sound reasonable?</p>              <p>-=

              <p>Two failed Southern California banks will reopen today und=
er new owners, after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. took control of th=
em late Friday.</p>              <p>Vineyard Bank of Corona, which has 16 b=
ranches, was sold to California Bank &amp; Trust of San Diego, the FDIC sai=
d. Separately, Temecula Valley Bank of Temecula and its 11 branches were so=
ld to First Citizens Bank and Trust of Raleigh, N.C.</p>              <p>Bo=
th Vineyard and Temecula Valley have been careening toward collapse for the=
 last year amid huge losses on loans related to real estate.</p>           =
   <p>Vineyard had assets of $1.9 billion as of March 31, the FDIC said. Te=
mecula Valley's assets were $1.5 billion as of May 31.</p>              <p>=
All deposits of the two banks, except those brought in by brokers, will be =
transferred to the acquiring banks. As often occurs in small-bank failures,=
 the FDIC will pay off the brokered deposits, which tend to be so-called ho=
t money that was looking for above-average yields on savings certificates.<=
/p>              <p>California Bank &amp; Trust, which has about $10 billio=
n in assets and 93 offices in California, is a unit of Zions Bancorp. of Ut=
ah.</p>              <p>First Citizens Bank, with $17.2 billion in assets, =
operates 354 branches mostly in the Southeast. But it also has a toehold in=
 California through its IronStone Bank unit, which has nine offices in the =
state, mainly in San Diego and Orange counties.</p>              <p>The FDI=
C said it entered into loss-sharing agreements with the acquiring banks to =
deal with the rotten assets of Vineyard and Temecula Valley. The FDIC will =
share losses with California Bank &amp; Trust on $1.5 billion of Vineyard's=
 assets. The agency will share losses with First Citizens Bank on $1.3 bill=
ion of Temecula Valley's assets.</p>              <p>Even so, the FDIC esti=
mated that the failures would cost its insurance fund nearly $1 billion in =
total -- $579 million for Vineyard and $391 million for Temecula Valley.</p=
>              <p>The demise of Vineyard and Temecula Valley brings the tot=
al number of failed U.S. banks this year to 57, including eight in Californ=
ia.</p>              <p>--</p>              <p>tom.petruno@latimes.com</p> =

     <p>On the back of a fantasy camp baseball card, Lyle Campbell listed b=
uying the St. Louis Cardinals, his favorite team, as his goal.</p>         =
     <p>He did come close to buying a Major League Baseball team, but not t=
he Cardinals.</p>              <p>In 1999, Steve Stone, now a Chicago White=
 Sox broadcaster, wanted to organize a group to buy the Oakland Athletics a=
nd, looking for backers, heard about Campbell.</p>              <p>&quot;Pr=
etty much unsolicited I walked into Founders Bank and met with him,&quot; r=
ecalled Stone, who said he had less than three weeks to put $12 million int=
o escrow to participate in the bidding process.</p>              <p>&quot;L=
yle believed in me and believed in this deal enough to go to Norm Bobins, t=
he esteemed Chicago banker, and we were able to get the $12 million to put =
into escrow,&quot; Stone said.</p>              <p>Bobins, then head of LaS=
alle Bank, said he remembers calling Bud Selig, the pro baseball commission=
er who he has known for years, and vouching for Campbell. Bobins said he kn=
ows Campbell &quot;very well&quot; and calls him a &quot;decent, honorable =
guy.&quot;</p>              <p>&quot;I don't think they ever borrowed any m=
oney from us, but I'm sure I told them it could be worked out,&quot; Bobins=
 said. &quot;I said if Lyle, at that time, was willing to stand behind it a=
nd put up some collateral, I thought we absolutely could get it done.&quot;=

s Bishop served as a reserve pilot in the Marine Corps for 35 years while t=
hriving in his civilian career as a banker.</p>              <p>He served a=
s director of what was then known as the Marine Corps Reserve Support Cente=
r and was instrumental in building the program, according to Brig. Gen. Den=
is Shortal.</p>              <p>&quot;On this military side he was never a =
wartime leader, he was a Chicagoan that went into the Marine Corps and stay=
ed for 35 years,&quot; said Col. Tim Carney, a fellow Marine. &quot;That's =
a personal sacrifice in itself.&quot;</p>              <p>Maj. Gen. Bishop,=
 76, died of lung cancer in his Romeoville home on Saturday, June 27, said =
his daughter Lynn Banks.</p>              <p>&quot;He was most proud of tod=
ay's Marine Corps and how they train their recruits now,&quot; Banks said.<=
/p>              <p>A native of Elizabeth, N.J., Maj. Gen. Bishop received =
a bachelor's degree in business from Miami University in Ohio in 1955 and w=
as a member of the NROTC program.</p>              <p>He was on active duty=
 in Pensacola, Fla., where he was a flight instructor in the late 1950s, hi=
s daughter said.</p>              <p>Ten years after his completion of Offi=
cers' Basic School, Maj. Gen. Bishop was promoted to major and assigned to =
Marine Attack Squadron 611, NAS in Glenview, where he was in charge of the =
reserve air units.</p>              <p>While there, he worked at various ba=
nks in the Chicago area, rising to senior executive vice president at the f=
ormer Exchange National Bank in the 1970s. &quot;What made him so unique wa=
s that he had a civilian career paralleling his military career,&quot; Carn=
ey said.</p>              <p>His mother nicknamed him &quot;Bus,&quot; shor=
t for Buster-- a moniker that stuck through his entire career with the Mari=
nes, even as he was promoted to the rank of two-star major general in 1986.=
</p>              <p>He acted as General of the Marine Corps Combat Develop=
ment Command until 1989. Until he retired in 1990, Maj. Gen. Bishop served =
as the president of the secretary of the Navy's Marine Corps Reserve Policy=
 Board. While at the Glenview base, Maj. Gen. Bishop managed the collection=
 and distribution for Toys for Tots in the Chicago area, said Carney.</p>  =
            <p>Maj. Gen. Bishop is also survived by his wife Frances; a son=
, Michael; two other daughters, Becky Behning and Katie Corcoran; four step=
children, Patrick Howery, Mark, Stephen and Matthew Kelly; a brother, Bobbi=
e MacLean; 15 grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.</p>              <p>=

 million and total deposits of $848.9 million.</p>              <p>Founders=

er suffering securities losses in the first quarter and falling to an &quot=
;undercapitalized&quot; status.</p>              <p>The failure of the Camp=

d. As of April 30, John Warner Bank had total assets of $70 million and tot=
al deposits of about $64 million. In addition to assuming all the deposits =
of the failed bank, State Bank of Lincoln agreed to buy about $63 million o=
f assets. The FDIC will retain the remaining assets for later disposition.<=
/p>              <p>The deposits of First State Bank of Winchester were acq=
uired by First National Bank of Beardstown, Ill. Two offices will reopen Mo=
nday under the new bank name. First State Bank had total assets of $36 mill=
ion and total deposits of about $34 million as of April 30. First National =
Bank also agreed to buy about $33 million of assets.</p>              <p>Ro=
ck River Bank's deposits and most of its assets were acquired by Harvard St=
ate Bank of Harvard. Four bank branches will reopen Monday as Harvard banks=
. At the end of April, Rock River Bank had $77 million in assets and $75.8 =
million in deposits.</p>              <p>Elizabeth State Bank's two offices=
 will reopen Monday as branches of Galena State Bank and Trust in Galena, I=
ll. In addition to assuming deposits, Galena agreed to buy $52.3 million of=
 the bank's assets. Elizabeth State had total assets of $55.5 million and t=
otal deposits of $50.4 million at the end of April.</p>              <p>The=
 seven offices of First National Bank of Danville will reopen Monday as bra=
nches of First Financial Bank of Terre Haute, Ind., which assumed all of th=

. of Chicago agreed to assume all of the deposits of Founders Bank. Its 11 =
offices will reopen Monday as branches of The PrivateBank, which also agree=
d to buy $888.4 million of assets. As of April 30, Founders Bank had total =
assets of $962.5 million and total deposits of $848.9 million.</p>         =
     <p>Founders Bank had gone on a search to try to raise about $50 millio=
n in capital after suffering securities losses in the first quarter and fal=
ling to an &quot;undercapitalized&quot; status.</p>              <p>The fai=
lure of the Campbell family's bank resulted primarily from losses on invest=
ments in risky instruments known as collateralized debt obligations and oth=
er loan losses, the FDIC said.</p>              <p>Deposits of John Warner =
Bank were acquired by Lincoln, Ill.-based State Bank of Lincoln. Three John=
 Warner Bank branches will reopen Friday as branches of State Bank of Linco=
ln, the FDIC said. As of April 30, John Warner Bank had total assets of $70=
 million and total deposits of about $64 million. In addition to assuming a=
ll the deposits of the failed bank, State Bank of Lincoln agreed to buy abo=
ut $63 million of assets. The FDIC will retain the remaining assets for lat=
er disposition.</p>              <p>The deposits of First State Bank of Win=
chester were acquired by First National Bank of Beardstown, Ill. Two office=
s will reopen Monday under the new bank name. First State Bank had total as=
sets of $36 million and total deposits of about $34 million as of April 30.=
 First National Bank also agreed to buy about $33 million of assets.</p>   =
           <p>Rock River Bank's deposits and most of its assets were acquir=

as Harvard banks. At the end of April, Rock River Bank had $77 million in a=
ssets and $75.8 million in deposits.</p>              <p>Elizabeth State Ba=
nk's two offices will reopen Monday as branches of Galena State Bank and Tr=
ust in Galena, Ill. In addition to assuming deposits, Galena agreed to buy =
$52.3 million of the bank's assets. Elizabeth State had total assets of $55=
.5 million and total deposits of $50.4 million at the end of April.</p>    =
          <p>The seven offices of First National Bank of Danville will reop=
en Monday as branches of First Financial Bank of Terre Haute, Ind., which a=
ssumed all of the bank's deposits. As of April 30, First National had total=
 assets of $166 million and total deposits of $147 million.</p>            =
  <p>Those Illinois banks, along with Dallas-based Millennium State Bank of=
 Texas, which also was seized, bring the number of U.S. bank failures this =
year to 52.</p>              <p>That's more than double the 25 which failed=
 in all of 2008 and the three closed in 2007. The Federal Deposit Insurance=
 Corp. was appointed receiver of all seven.</p>              <p>The total c=

came the first bank in Texas to fail this year. Its sole office will reopen=
 on Monday as a branch of Irving, Texas-based State Bank of Texas, which is=
 assuming all of Millennium's deposits. State Bank of Texas also agreed to =
buy essentially all of the bank's assets. As of June 30, Millennium had tot=
al assets of about $118 million and total deposits of $115 million.</p>    =

          <p>Gabby Ornelas, a former teller at the giant Bank of America Co=
rp., remembers the training sessions. And she remembers her marching orders=
: &quot;Sell, sell, sell.&quot;</p>              <p>Ornelas was instructed =
to use her Spanish-language skills and Latino heritage to sign up customers=
 for as many kinds of banking services as possible, she said -- services th=
at led to lucrative fees for the bank and financial entanglement for many c=
ustomers.</p>              <p>&quot;We were coached every day to push multi=
ple checking accounts, credit cards and debit cards even when the customer =
didn't understand how to use them,&quot; said Ornelas, who lives in Landove=
r Hills, Md., a town with a large immigrant population and a per-capita inc=
ome of less than $19,000.</p>              <p>In one case, she described a =
Central American mother of three who came back to see her at the bank, dist=
ressed about $300 in overdraft fees incurred after Ornelas persuaded the wo=
man to open a second checking account.</p>              <p>Ornelas and eigh=
t of her colleagues leveled the accusations in recent interviews. They are =
being backed in their whistle-blowing by the Service Employees Internationa=
l Union, which is trying to organize BofA, the nation's largest bank.</p>  =
            <p>Bank of America officials flatly rejected the allegations, s=
aying their policies are legal, adhere to industry standards and are helpfu=
l to customers, including immigrants seeking a toehold in the United States=
.</p>              <p>&quot;Bank of America believes the SEIU's claims misr=
epresent the bank's relationship with its customers and its associates,&quo=
t; said Anne Pace, a bank spokeswoman.</p>              <p>The former worke=
rs said they were going public to lay out what they saw as a little-known s=
ide of BofA's business model: encouraging working-class customers to sign u=
p for high-interest-rate credit and cash advance services and structuring a=
n array of check and debit card services to maximize overdraft fees and oth=
er charges.</p>              <p>The campaign will be launched publicly this=
 week, with workers scheduled to tell their stories in news conference call=
s and meetings with members of Congress. The union is seeking to pressure t=
he bank and to build support for legislation now stalled in the Senate that=
 would make it easier for union members to organize.</p>              <p>Bo=
fA said the former employees were a disgruntled minority and that internal =
surveys showed that most employees of the company were overwhelmingly satis=
fied.</p>              <p>Other critics of the SEIU said the union might ha=
ve a conflict of interest because it has outstanding loans with the bank.</=
p>              <p>Many of the workers speaking out were fired from the ban=
k, most before they took their complaints public. One worker has said her f=
iring was related to her interest in the union. One worker is still employe=
d at BofA.</p>              <p>BofA's Pace said that all of the bank's acti=
vities were not only legal but also useful to consumers, particularly those=
 who have recently arrived in the U.S.</p>              <p>&quot;We believe=
 a checking account is the cornerstone to establishing financial security i=
n this country,&quot; Pace said in an e-mail. &quot;We offer innovative fin=
ancial services to meet the needs of all of our customers, including Hispan=
ic customers.&quot;</p>              <p>Pace also said the bank had taken s=
teps to help customers facing &quot;financial challenges.&quot; For example=
, she said, the bank waives certain monthly fees for customers who have los=
t their jobs and has reduced penalty fees for customers who overdraw their =
accounts by less than $5.</p>              <p>Although BofA denies wrongdoi=
ng, it recently paid $35 million to settle a class-action suit in Californi=
a that alleged it deliberately ranked customer debits by order of size rath=
er than by the time of day they occurred in order to maximize overdraft cha=
rges.</p>              <p>Pace said that the settlement does not include an=
y acknowledgment of wrongdoing or even of the practices alleged in the suit=
, and that the bank paid the $35 million to avoid excessive legal bills.</p=
>              <p>Consumer advocates see it differently.</p>              <=
p>&quot;Bank of America has moved to the top of the charts for fees being c=
harged to consumers by big banks,&quot; said Jean Ann Fox, director of fina=
ncial services for the Consumer Federation of America.</p>              <p>=
Ornelas and three other former BofA tellers, all Latinas, said they and co-=
workers were repeatedly instructed to seek potential new Spanish-speaking c=
ustomers outside the bank. Some were instructed to go to embassies where re=
cent emigres often wait in line for visa and passport services.</p>        =
      <p>Other tellers were asked to go to neighborhood stores, clinics and=
 child welfare centers, and several were asked to recruit customers at a re=
ligiously oriented Mother's Day celebration, they said.</p>              <p=
>&quot;We were told to push them to sign up for multiple checking accounts,=
 which they didn't need,&quot; said Ambar Sandoval, a former teller at a Bo=
fA branch in Central Los Angeles who said she repeatedly resisted pressure =
to recruit customers at a center for single mothers in Los Angeles.</p>    =
          <p>The ex-employees provided some documentation for their claims,=
 including internal bank memos showing a schedule of opportunities to solic=
it accounts among the crowds at Central American embassies and Latino commu=
nity events. The documents also showed details of the sales goals pressed o=
n branch employees.</p>              <p>Consumer advocate Fox was particula=
rly critical of banks' practice of recording debits by order of magnitude, =
which half the country's leading banks do. Fox said the practice makes it m=
ore likely that even careful consumers will overdraw their account.</p>    =
          <p>BofA defends the practice, saying it assures customers that th=
eir largest, most important payments have priority.</p>              <p>Fox=
 said it's a tactic banks use to make sure their fee revenues remain high. =
She said consumers unwittingly and unfairly incur overdraft fees when using=
 a debit card.</p>              <p>&quot;People think that if they use thei=
r debit card, they will only spend money that they have in their accounts. =
But Bank of America and other big banks have found ways to turn your debit =
card into a credit instrument with which you can rack up extreme debt,&quot=
; she said.</p>              <p>For example, BofA permits a customer using =
a debit card to spend, say, $20 at a grocery store even if the bank account=
 is depleted. Without informing the customer, the bank automatically impose=
s an overdraft fee of $35. An additional $35 fee is imposed less than a wee=
k later if the account is still out of balance.</p>              <p>These r=
ates mean that consumers are in effect paying $70 for a $20 extension of cr=
edit at the grocery store, Fox said.</p>              <p>Pace said BofA off=
ers overdraft protection and other services to &quot;give our customers mor=
e control and flexibility to effectively manage their accounts and prevent =
fees.&quot;</p>              <p>--</p>              <p>tom.hamburger@latime=

/head>            <body>              <p>The Supreme Court ruled Monday tha=
t states could enforce some of their consumer protection laws against natio=
nal banks, a move that could lead to tougher oversight than federal regulat=
ors have provided in recent years.</p>              <p>The 5-4 decision in =
a case involving attempts by New York's attorney general to enforce fair-le=
nding laws was praised by consumer and civil rights groups, which have accu=
sed federal regulators of being lax in policing banks chartered by the fede=
ral government.</p>              <p>&quot;This puts more consumer cops on t=
he consumer crime beat,&quot; said Edmund Mierzwinski, consumer program dir=
ector at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. &quot;The federal regulat=
ors have demonstrated they're just having doughnuts in the coffee shop.&quo=
t;</p>              <p>Banking trade groups, however, warned that the rulin=
g could lead to a confusing patchwork of enforcement levels in states that =
could cause national banks to offer fewer products, such as credit cards.</=
p>              <p>&quot;This will make it difficult to serve consumers in =
today's high-tech, mobile society where people and bank services move const=
antly across state lines,&quot; said Edward L. Yingling, president of the A=
merican Bankers Assn.</p>              <p>The ruling has limited effect bec=
ause it applies only to a small number of state laws, such as those dealing=
 with discrimination in lending practices, including predatory lending. Mos=
t other state laws affecting national banks are enforced by federal officia=
ls.</p>              <p>And it affects only the approximately 1,600 nationa=
l banks, not the larger number of state banks that are subject to the laws =
of the states in which they're chartered.</p>              <p>But it is sig=
nificant because it reverses a trend of states losing legal battles with fe=
deral officials over banking regulatory oversight.</p>              <p>The =
case's importance also could be amplified by President Obama's recent propo=
sal to create a Consumer Financial Protection Agency that would allow state=
s to enact and enforce tougher consumer protection laws than the federal go=
vernment.</p>              <p>&quot;If Obama's plan goes forward, it will b=
roaden and strengthen this decision dramatically,&quot; Mierzwinski said.</=
p>              <p>The case involved an attempt by former New York Atty. Ge=
n. Eliot Spitzer in 2005 to investigate bank lending practices, such as whe=
ther a disproportionately large percentage of high-interest mortgages were =
made to minorities.</p>              <p>After Spitzer sent letters of inqui=
ry to national banks, including Wells Fargo &amp; Co., Citibank and JP Morg=
an Chase &amp; Co., a bank consortium called the Clearing House Assn. filed=
 suit to stop the investigation.</p>              <p>The Treasury Departmen=
t's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates national ban=
ks, also filed suit, arguing that Spitzer was improperly encroaching on its=
 rule under an 1864 law that it was the only entity with the &quot;visitori=
al power&quot; to examine such banks. The suits were combined and upheld by=
 lower courts.</p>              <p>But Spitzer's successor, Andrew Cuomo, a=
ppealed to the Supreme Court, arguing in part that the federal agency's int=
erpretation in effect shielded national banks from states' enforcing their =
own laws to protect consumers and prohibit discrimination.</p>             =
 <p>In the 5-4 decision, Justice Antonin Scalia split with his conservative=
 colleagues, joining the liberal and moderate members in ruling the Office =
of the Comptroller of the Currency had overstepped its bounds.</p>         =
     <p>In writing the court's decision, Scalia said law enforcement invest=
igations were different from bank examinations.</p>              <p>&quot;I=
f a state chooses to pursue enforcement of its laws in court, then it is no=
t exercising its power of visitation and will be treated like a litigant,&q=
uot; Scalia said.</p>              <p>A state would have to meet a higher s=
tandard than a regulatory examiner, he wrote, because it would have to surv=
ive motions to dismiss the case by the bank.</p>              <p>The state,=
 he wrote, also would be subject to oversight by judges who &quot;are trust=
ed to prevent 'fishing expeditions' or an undirected rummaging through bank=
 books and records for evidence of some unknown wrongdoing.&quot;</p>      =
        <p>The attorneys general of the 49 other states and the District of=
 Columbia supported New York. They argued in a brief that the &quot;fallout=
 from the subprime lending debacle demonstrates the need for more oversight=
 and consumer protection enforcement in the area of mortgage lending.&quot;=

              <p>Denial, noun: An unconscious defense mechanism characteriz=
ed by refusal to acknowledge painful realities, thoughts or feelings.</p>  =
            <p>-- The American Heritage Medical Dictionary</p>             =
 <p>--</p>              <p>The banking industry wasted no time last week de=
claring its opposition to President Obama's proposal for a regulatory agenc=
y that would protect consumers from rapacious lending practices.</p>       =
       <p>While acknowledging that &quot;regulatory reform is badly needed,=
&quot; Edward Yingling, president of the American Bankers Assn., said the n=
ew agency would have &quot;powers to mandate loans and services that go wel=
l beyond consumer protection.&quot;</p>              <p>The Financial Servi=
ces Roundtable said it applauded &quot;modernizing regulation of the financ=
ial services industry.&quot; But it too opposes the new agency &quot;becaus=
e it will not adequately serve the best interests of consumers and their fi=
nancial institutions.&quot;</p>              <p>The Consumer Bankers Assn. =
chimed in by saying the proposed agency &quot;would create a maze of regula=
tions suppressing creativity and product innovation.&quot;</p>             =
 <p>These guys just don't get it.</p>              <p>The reason Obama want=
s to create a Consumer Financial Protection Agency isn't that he's hell-ben=
t on imposing his will on banks. It's that banks have consistently proved t=
hemselves unworthy of customers' trust.</p>              <p>From runaway cr=
edit card interest rates to mortgages that turn into one-way trips to forec=
losure, lenders have repeatedly demonstrated their inability to deal with c=
ustomers fairly and responsibly.</p>              <p>Instead, they place th=
eir own interests ahead of all other considerations, and in so doing expose=
 frequently unsophisticated consumers to enormous risk and financial ruin.<=
/p>              <p>The banks have only themselves to blame for why a Consu=
mer Financial Protection Agency is needed.</p>              <p>&quot;They w=
recked the system,&quot; said Gail Hillebrand, senior attorney with Consume=
rs Union. &quot;What they're saying is that they want to keep doing busines=
s as usual. But business as usual has failed us.&quot;</p>              <p>=
In announcing measures to improve oversight of financial markets, Obama sai=
d that &quot;a culture of irresponsibility&quot; had taken root on Wall Str=
eet and elsewhere.</p>              <p>Acknowledging that many people took =
out loans they couldn't afford, he said &quot;there were also millions of A=
mericans who signed contracts they didn't always understand offered by lend=
ers who didn't always tell the truth.&quot;</p>              <p>The Consume=
r Financial Protection Agency would be charged with ending deceptive practi=
ces and ensuring that information provided by lenders is accurate and easy =
to understand.</p>              <p>What's truly shocking is that this sort =
of thing has to be legislated. You'd think banks would be able to compete a=
nd succeed by treating customers with integrity. But left to their own devi=
ces, they do just the opposite.</p>              <p>&quot;Companies compete=
 not by offering better products but more complicated ones, with more fine =
print and more hidden terms,&quot; Obama said.</p>              <p>So like =
naughty children, they get a time out and some new rules to follow.</p>    =
          <p>Wayne Abernathy, a spokesman for the American Bankers Assn., t=
old me his industry has gotten a bum rap. Major lenders aren't to blame for=
 problems making consumers' lives miserable, he said.</p>              <p>&=
quot;I can't deny that's the impression out there,&quot; Abernathy said. &q=
uot;But it's not us.&quot;</p>              <p>He said the real culprits we=
re smaller financial institutions operating primarily at the state level th=
at were reckless in their lending practices.</p>              <p>&quot;When=
 their products blow up, we get tarnished,&quot; Abernathy said.</p>       =
       <p>Well, no.</p>              <p>At least not when you consider that=
 American Express, Bank of America, Capital One, Citigroup, Discover and JP=
Morgan Chase account for about 80% of the credit card industry.</p>        =
      <p>Or when you consider that the top four mortgage lenders as of the =
first quarter of the year were Wells Fargo, BofA, Chase and Citi. Together =
they accounted for more than half of all residential loans originating in t=
he period.</p>              <p>Obama is targeting the big boys because all =
roads lead to their doors. And it could be argued that if anyone should kno=
w better, they should.</p>              <p>It could also be argued that the=
se guys should have nothing to fear from a Consumer Financial Protection Ag=
ency if, as they say, their business is already on the up and up. What's a =
little accountability among friends?</p>              <p>Banks say a new re=
gulatory agency would increase their costs. Since when has treating people =
respectfully added to expenses? They say it will stifle creativity and inno=
vation. That just sounds like an excuse for laziness.</p>              <p>T=
he simple fact is that banks have lost consumers' trust and the onus is on =
them to earn it back. And while they're doing so, government regulators wil=
l be watching to make sure everyone plays nicely.</p>              <p>That'=
s why we need a Consumer Financial Protection Agency.</p>              <p>T=
hat's why the bankers need to wake up to reality.</p>              <p>--</p=

  <title></title>            </head>            <body>              <p>Trea=
sury Secretary Timothy Geithner signaled Wednesday that the nation's bigges=
t banks may be able to raise the billions of dollars they need to get healt=
hy again without further taxpayer money.</p>              <p>But even as he=
 tried to ease anxiety about the big-bank &quot;stress test&quot; results d=
ue Thursday, some experts warned that government efforts to unlock the lend=
ing market may well face another hurdle not being addressed by that exercis=
e.</p>              <p>The smaller banks that make up a large part of the n=
ation's commercial lending, they say, are under growing strain due to the d=
eepening recession, exposure to the faltering commercial real estate market=
 and demands that they also shore up their capital. Faced with such an unce=
rtain outlook, many are hunkered down and reluctant to take risk, which is =
helping to thwart efforts by Treasury officials to jump-start the lending n=
eeded to fuel an economic recovery.</p>              <p>&quot;You go into s=
ell-preservation mode. You stop lending and no amount of pressure [from Was=
hington] will change that,&quot; said Brian Battle, vice president of Perfo=
rmance Trust Capital Partners, which advises middle-market banks.</p>      =
        <p>Banking experts applaud the government's efforts to shore up the=
 system's giants.</p>              <p>The stress tests involved the country=
's 19 largest banks and were designed to identify which institutions must r=
aise their capital levels. Geithner said in a television interview that the=
 results &quot;will be, on balance, reassuring,&quot; and that &quot;none o=
f those 19 banks are at risk for insolvency,&quot; Bloomberg News reported.=
</p>              <p>That's important because hulks like Bank of America an=
d Citigroup are so intertwined with each other and the rest of the global f=
inancial system that failure could well be catastrophic.</p>              <=
p>&quot;If the big banks were still screwed up, it wouldn't matter if the s=
mall banks were all fine,&quot; said Anil Kashyap, a professor of economics=
 and finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.</p>    =
          <p>But that doesn't mean smaller banks are somehow inconsequentia=
l. The nearly 8,300 banks with less than $100 billion in assets, the stress=
 test cutoff, fill a vital role in the growth and prosperity of the U.S. ec=
onomy.</p>              <p>Data from research company Foresight Analytics L=
LC show that while these banks make up 28 percent of the industry's total a=
ssets, they are responsible for about 60 percent of the nation's commercial=
 real estate lending and roughly a third of the general business lending th=
at local economies thrive on.</p>              <p>That makes them especiall=
y vulnerable to what many believe will be the next phase of the real estate=
 crisis -- a sharp downturn in commercial real estate values. Deepening une=
mployment and business strife have begun to push up commercial delinquency =
rates, said Foresight partner Matthew Anderson. And that is putting pressur=
e on banks with heavy concentrations of commercial loans.</p>              =
<p>The result has been a spike in the number of bank failures. Foresight re=
ports that 56 banks have collapsed since 2007, and the firm expects the num=
ber to jump to 150 by the end of this year. The Federal Deposit Insurance C=
orp.'s list of &quot;problem banks&quot; swelled past 250 in the fourth qua=
rter, and the number of failures and &quot;assistance transactions&quot; in=
 2008 was at a 15-year high.</p>              <p>These numbers still trail =
the devastation the banking industry suffered during the savings and loan c=
risis in the early 1990s. But the issue is this: More failures indicate gro=
wing stress in the broader banking market, stress that could become acute i=
f the recession continues to undermine the commercial real estate market. B=
ankers are clearly worried. An April survey of lending officers by the Fede=
ral Reserve showed that 70 percent of them were anticipating deterioration =
in all types of commercial and household loans.</p>              <p>Bankers=
 complain that despite the pressure from Washington to lend, examiners in t=
he field are tougher to please than ever.</p>              <p>&quot;When yo=
u make loans, you are subject to scrutiny, so why make loans?&quot; said Je=
ffrey Taft, a regulatory attorney with Mayer Brown in Washington, D.C. &quo=
t;The joke is, regulators want you to make responsible loans, but they'll t=
ell you what responsible is.&quot;</p>              <p>The result isn't fun=
ny. Though indications are that the economy is reaching a bottom, many expe=
rts say this ongoing lack of lending by smaller banks is one reason a real =
recovery may be a long time in coming.</p>              <p>----------</p>  =

): Small banks on the edgeBig banks have been in the spotlight lately, but =
hundreds of smaller banks are also feeling pain, putting a drag on the econ=
omic recovery. A watch list of U.S. banks with thin capital or high levels =
of non-performing loans has been exploding. One problem: Smaller banks have=
 a disproportionate reliance on commercial real estate lending.*Watch list =
data provided by Foresight Analytics. Includes banks with low levels of reg=
ulatory capital or high levels of non-performing loans.Data for Q1 2009 are=
 incomplete because not all institutions have reported. Foresight expects t=
he 2009 number to grow.TRIBUNE NEWSPAPERS- See microfilm for complete graph=

      <body>              <p>Former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson and=
 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke threatened to oust Bank of Americ=
a Corp.'s board and its chief executive, Kenneth Lewis, if the bank called =
off its purchase of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Lewis said in sworn testimony =
released Thursday.</p>              <p>Under questioning by New York state =
authorities, Lewis said the nation's most powerful economic officials told =
him the entire financial system would be crippled if he backed out of the d=
eal in December, allowing Merrill to fail.</p>              <p>Lewis said t=
hey told him to wait more than three weeks before disclosing that Merrill's=
 losses were mounting by billions of dollars, until it could be announced t=
hat the bank was getting a second infusion of federal bailout funds.</p>   =
           <p>&quot;I was instructed that 'We do not want a public disclosu=
re,' &quot; Lewis said of the events in December, after BofA shareholders h=
ad voted to approve the $50-billion Merrill takeover but before the deal be=
came final Jan. 1.</p>              <p>At the time, Bank of America already=
 had accepted $25 billion in bailout funds from the U.S. Treasury. In the e=
nd, Lewis and his board went along with Paulson's and Bernanke's alleged de=
mands, but only after Paulson pledged to deliver an additional $20 billion =
in bailout money and backstop $118 billion in toxic assets on Merrill's boo=
ks.</p>              <p>Lewis said that with the extra government assistanc=
e, he was persuaded that the deal within two or three years would still ben=
efit his bank as well as the country.</p>              <p>The highly critic=
ized deal, which contributed to a sharp decline in Bank of America's stock,=
 has led to numerous shareholder lawsuits and threats from some investors t=
o try to oust Lewis from the bank's board at the annual meeting next week.<=
/p>              <p>The events, during the waning days of the Bush administ=
ration, illustrate the remarkable degree to which the government, fearing a=
n economic meltdown, intervened in the affairs of banks and other financial=
 firms.</p>              <p>But its aggressive efforts, which have continue=
d under President Obama, have proved costly for Bank of America -- and coul=
d cost the bank even more in the end.</p>              <p>Mark Molumphy, on=
e of a number of lawyers who have filed suits on behalf of Bank of America =
shareholders who contend the company improperly withheld information, was g=
leeful at Thursday's revelations. He said the material was &quot;a remarkab=
le revelation that frankly confirms everything that the shareholders have b=
een alleging in their complaints.&quot;</p>              <p>&quot;Behind cl=
osed doors the shareholders of Bank of America were being disregarded by th=
ose who were entrusted to protect them,&quot; said Molumphy, an attorney wi=
th Cotchett, Pitre &amp; McCarthy in Burlingame. &quot;Their spin is that t=
hey were being patriotic. If being a patriot means doing something that's n=
ot in the best interest of Bank of America, then I think it's kind of a hol=
low explanation.&quot;</p>              <p>A statement issued Thursday by a=
 Bernanke spokeswoman denied that the Fed told Lewis what he could or could=
 not disclose. But the statement didn't address whether the central bank ha=
d threatened to replace Lewis and BofA's board.</p>              <p>A Pauls=
on spokeswoman said Paulson had delivered a message from the Fed that the c=
ontract to buy Merrill was unbreakable, warning that it was &quot;unthinkab=
le that Bank of America take this action for which there was no reasonable =
legal basis and which would show a lack of judgment.&quot;</p>             =
 <p>The bank declined to comment Thursday except to say it had acted &quot;=
legally and appropriately.&quot;</p>              <p>Like many Wall Street =
firms, Merrill Lynch ran into trouble creating complex investments tied to =
subprime mortgages and other high-risk debt. As mortgage defaults spiked la=
st summer, these assets became virtually worthless. On Sept. 15, when Lewis=
 agreed to take over Merrill after only a weekend of discussions, the Wall =
Street firm was within a week of collapse, according to New York Atty. Gen.=
 Andrew Cuomo, whose lawyers investigated the case and interviewed Lewis, P=
aulson and others involved. (Bernanke refused to testify, citing a bank reg=
ulator privilege.)</p>              <p>To call off the Merrill deal after i=
t was approved by shareholders would have meant declaring that a &quot;mate=
rial adverse change&quot; had occurred at Merrill. Depositions released by =
Cuomo showed the Fed maintained that no such event had occurred despite the=
 discovery of losses that had reached $12 billion as of Dec. 14.</p>       =
       <p>Cuomo forwarded the testimony Thursday to the House and Senate ba=
nking committees, a congressional panel overseeing the government's financi=
al bailout plan, and the Securities and Exchange Commission -- the federal =
watchdog for shareholders, which was absent from the government's emergency=
 efforts.</p>              <p>&quot;Indeed,&quot; Cuomo wrote in a cover le=
tter, &quot;Secretary Paulson informed this office that he did not keep the=
 SEC chairman in the loop during the discussions and negotiations with Bank=
 of America in December 2008.&quot;</p>              <p>The events appeared=
 to underscore a schism between the SEC and bank regulators, two goliath re=
gulatory regimes with markedly different concerns and methods.</p>         =
     <p>While the SEC's mission is to encourage corporations to disclose im=
portant events, banking regulators &quot;sweep problems under the rug,&quot=
; said Columbia University securities law professor John C. Coffee.</p>    =
          <p>&quot;The worst outcome from their point of view is that adver=
se information reaches shareholders, who may panic&quot; and cause banks to=
 collapse, Coffee said.</p>              <p>He predicted the failure to dis=
close Merrill's problems would multiply the amount Bank of America will hav=
e to pay to settle shareholder litigation over the acquisition.</p>        =
      <p>Steve Adamske, an aide to House Financial Services Committee Chair=
man Barney Frank (D-Mass.), said the disclosures underscore the need to emp=
ower the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. or some other regulatory body to m=
ove in early to seize and &quot;wind down&quot; failing non-bank financial =
institutions like Merrill Lynch, as the FDIC can do with failing banks and =
thrifts that take deposits.</p>              <p>--</p>              <p>scot=

></title>            </head>            <body>              <p>Government t=
ests on the financial health of the nation's major banks are causing signif=
icant stress on Wall Street and in Washington, where bankers and officials =
fear that the release of highly anticipated information may do more harm th=
an good.</p>              <p>The Obama administration is finding itself in =
a potentially no-win situation as it prepares to release details Friday abo=
ut the methodology used in the tests, and at least partial results May 4. T=
he so-called stress tests will determine whether the banks need more govern=
ment bailout money and the $700-billion rescue fund needs to be replenished=
.</p>              <p>Regulators and administration officials are still wre=
stling with how much of the test results to disclose.</p>              <p>R=
eleasing too much information could undermine the banks' health -- the very=
 thing that the administration is trying to avoid, experts said. Revealing =
too little after weeks of buildup would cast doubt on the process and creat=
e a vacuum in which investors and depositors would make their own assumptio=
ns, possibly leading to runs on the weakest banks.</p>              <p>&quo=
t;They've gotten themselves in a pickle on this thing,&quot; said Bert Ely,=
 an independent banking analyst. &quot;It's clear they didn't think through=
 how this was going to play out.&quot;</p>              <p>The goal of the =
tests is to figure out whether Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and 17=
 other banks with more than $100 billion in assets each need more money ove=
r the next two years to ride out a possible worsening of the recession. The=
y have received a total of about $214 billion in bailout money.</p>        =
      <p>No banks will fail the test, administration officials have said, b=
ut the results will determine whether they have to raise more capital. If t=
hey can't do that in six months, the government will step in with funds to =
shore up operations at the banks, which are deemed too big to fail.</p>    =
          <p>White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs downplayed concerns t=
hat the tests may be counterproductive.</p>              <p>&quot;I think r=
ather than these being seen as a destabilizing activity, that instead they =
will be seen as a stabilizing activity, that our hope is that banks that ar=
e not healthy or need help will first and foremost seek that help privately=
, and then we'll take steps from there to assist them,&quot; he said. &quot=
;But I think this is part of a longer process, towards bringing some stabil=
ity to the financial system.&quot;</p>              <p>Top Obama administra=
tion economic officials have been using the tests to ward off broader quest=
ions about plans for stabilizing the banking sector, portraying them as the=
 crucial step to take before addressing whether more money is needed.</p>  =
            <p>The tests are expected to be finished by the end of the mont=
h, with release of some information on May 4 from regulators and possibly b=
y the banks themselves, according to a federal regulatory official, who req=
uested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the =
tests. Exactly what kind of information will be released is &quot;under act=
ive discussions,&quot; the official said.</p>              <p>Regulatory re=
views of banks normally are kept secret to avoid shaking the confidence of =
investors and to keep customers from racing to withdraw their money. In thi=
s case, however, no news would not be good news. If the administration says=
 little about the test results, Wall Street and the public are likely to as=
sume the results were not good, analysts said. If the administration releas=
es detailed information, however, it would identify which of the large bank=
s are weaker, potentially destabilizing them.</p>              <p>&quot;If =
they draw differentiations, what you're effectively doing is tying a target=
 on the back of the weak ones,&quot; analyst Ely said.</p>              <p>=
To avoid misinterpretations, the administration plans to release details ab=
out the testing process Friday to give the public and investors a grounding=
 for whatever data are released May 4, the regulatory official said.</p>   =
           <p>Wayne Abernathy, executive director for financial institution=
s policy and regulatory affairs at the American Bankers Assn., said the Oba=
ma administration must be cautious about what it releases from the tests.</=
p>              <p>&quot;If you're not careful about what you put out, you =
would erode confidence in the bank,&quot; he said.</p>              <p>But =
failing to release enough information could undermine confidence in the bai=
louts, said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer =
Federation of America.</p>              <p>&quot;The public is being asked =
to fund this bailout. They have a right to full disclosure about the nature=
 of their investments,&quot; she said.</p>              <p>A lack of detail=
s also may cause a backlash in Congress, which would decide whether to expa=
nd the $700-billion financial rescue fund. Lawmakers from both parties have=
 complained that there weren't enough strings attached to the bailout money=
. And Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Financial Services=
 Committee, said last week that the test results should be made public.</p>=
              <p>When the stress test plan emerged in February as a kind of=
 souped-up version of regular regulatory bank examinations, senior administ=
ration officials said the government did not plan to release the results.</=
p>              <p>They said, however, the public was likely to learn indir=
ectly which banks did well as the institutions either tried to raise funds =
or reported that they needed no additional capital. Any new infusions of ba=
ilout money -- the banks can request government funds immediately -- also w=
ould be disclosed.</p>              <p>The topic of the stress tests came u=
p during a meeting at the White House late last month between President Oba=
ma and 15 top executives from the nation's largest banks, all recipients of=
 bailout money, according to bank executives who were knowledgeable about t=
he meeting but not authorized to discuss it publicly.</p>              <p>T=
he bankers told Obama that the initial information released about the test =
had been too limited, and that they urged the president to &quot;put an end=
 to the issue&quot; by announcing the results in a &quot;clear, transparent=
 and definitive way,&quot; according to one of those people.</p>           =
   <p>The Federal Reserve has told the banks not to reveal the results of t=
he tests, just as they are barred from disclosing the results of regulatory=
 exams, said another bank executive.</p>              <p>The ban on disclos=
ing regulatory findings is designed to prevent deposit runs at institutions=
 that appear weak, something that analysts warn the government is risking i=
n conducting the stress tests.</p>              <p>The Securities and Excha=
nge Commission requires public companies to publicly report any &quot;mater=
ial corporate event.&quot; Banks and regulators are trying to figure out wh=
ether the stress tests are simply bank exams or something more, said Scott =
Talbott, chief lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable, which repres=
ents large financial institutions.</p>              <p>&quot;It's going to =
be a challenge,&quot; he said of the administration's decision about how mu=
ch information to release. &quot;My advice would be to take a look at the t=
otal results and weigh the balance between transparency and protecting the =
system.&quot;</p>              <p>In a report on the tests last week titled=
 &quot;Total Confusion,&quot; analyst Richard X. Bove of Rochdale Securitie=
s contended that the government had backed itself into a corner because the=
re was &quot;no effective way to communicate the results of this test witho=
ut causing greater stress than the test itself.&quot;</p>              <p>-=

p>Amid the recession and the popularity of Internet banking, there's still =
a market for bank offices in Chicago.</p>              <p>There are more th=
an 100 banks and 700 branches operating within city limits, according to Re=
dEye's analysis of data from individual banks and the Federal Deposit Insur=
ance Corp.</p>              <p>The three banks with the most branches in th=
e city are Chase Bank, Bank of America and TCF. Chase has 135 branches in t=
he city, counting 31 Washington Mutual branches that will be branded as Cha=
se Banks by August, Chase spokeswoman Christine Holevas said.</p>          =
    <p>&quot;There are a lot of people who really like to go to the branch =
to sit down across the desk from a banker and talk about whatever,&quot; Ho=
levas said.</p>              <p>In most neighborhoods, there's a bank on ev=
ery corner, except for some areas on the South Side such as Riverdale and W=
est Pullman. RedEye takes a look at which institutions have the most branch=

re solvent when they're not.</p>              <p>Their pretense is importan=
t because the most valuable asset bankers can own is the confidence of the =
public -- which, as Adam Smith observed in &quot;The Wealth of Nations,&quo=
t; is worth its weight in gold and silver.</p>              <p>At the momen=
t, confidence in bankers is at a low ebb. The only thing keeping mobs of de=
positors from the banks' front doors braying for their money is federal dep=
osit insurance -- and even that hasn't kept customer panic from bringing do=
wn such weakened institutions as IndyMac Bank.</p>              <p>So it's =
unsurprising that in an effort to restore confidence, bankers will try anyt=
hing. One of their main thrusts is to press for a change in their accountin=
g rules, which they say make some banks look sicker than they really are.</=
p>              <p>Curiously enough, they may be right.</p>              <p=
>Banks may be heading into a cycle of terrific profitability, in part becau=
se they currently enjoy a low cost of capital and the credit support of the=
 federal government. Chastened by the excesses of the recent past, they are=
 taking care to make only the most solid, and therefore profitable, loans g=
oing forward.</p>              <p>The top banks' &quot;earning power . . . =
has never been better on new business,&quot; Warren Buffett told CNBC a few=
 weeks ago. Just last week, a group of the savviest investors on Wall Stree=
t took over IndyMac, convinced that billions can be made from &quot;old-fas=
hioned banking,&quot; as one executive put it. (Especially because the FDIC=
 will eat more than $10 billion of IndyMac's past losses.)</p>             =
 <p>All that stands between them and Nirvana, the banking industry says, is=
 an accounting rule requiring that they put the absolute worst face on thei=
r most questionable loans. Allow them to apply just a bit of rouge and glit=
ter, they say, and they'll once again be the belles of the financial ball.<=
/p>              <p>This brings us to the concept of &quot;mark-to-market&q=
uot; accounting. If you haven't heard this term before, brace yourself, bec=
ause you'll be hearing it a lot over the next month or so.</p>             =
 <p>Mark-to-market means valuing an asset on your books, or &quot;marking&q=
uot; it, at its market price. Every time you check the action of the stocks=
 in your 401(k) portfolio, you're mentally marking them to market.</p>     =
         <p>A 2008 accounting rule obligates banks to apply mark-to-market =
accounting to assets they were holding for eventual sale, such as mortgage =
pools or mortgage bonds. No one worried about this at first because a thriv=
ing market existed for the paper and values were therefore easy to establis=
h.</p>              <p>But almost at the moment the rule went into effect, =
the market dried up. Because of the perception that trillions of dollars of=
 mortgage-backed securities harbored hundreds of billions of dollars of los=
ses from housing defaults and foreclosures, bond traders suddenly refused t=
o buy the securities at the prices the banks were asking. The banks, meanwh=
ile, wouldn't sell them for the prices the traders offered.</p>            =
  <p>This left the banks with two related problems: They were stuck with se=
curities they had planned to sell, and they had to write them down to the o=
nly prices at which they would trade -- pennies on the dollar. A tsunami of=
 declared losses swamped the banking sector. (We're still waist-deep in the=
 water.)</p>              <p>Bankers complain that the problem isn't so muc=
h the toxic mortgage bonds on their books but the way they are forced to ac=
count for them. They say that mark-to-market, which aimed to tie bank accou=
nting closer to reality (on the principle that any asset is worth only what=
 people will pay for it), actually distorts reality.</p>              <p>Th=
ere isn't a genuine market for mortgage assets at the moment, they say, so =
prices are being set by a few panicky institutions engaging in fire sales. =
They draw an analogy with the price you'd get for your home if you took thr=
ee or four months to wait for the best offer versus what you'd get if you h=
ad to sell it by noon today.</p>              <p>These are the same assets,=
 by the way, that are the subject of the new bank rescue plan to be unveile=
d by the White House today. The plan would transfer these assets to the Tre=
asury or private investors who won't need to dump them quickly. But it's pr=
oper to note that if mark-to-market is liberalized, some banks will demand =
higher prices from the Treasury for their so-called toxic waste.</p>       =
       <p>&quot;Market prices are all being driven by institutions with the=
ir backs to the wall, selling at desperation prices,&quot; William Isaac, a=
 former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., told me recently. =
He blames the accounting rule for much of the damage in the banking sector =
that made the $700-billion federal TARP bailout necessary.</p>             =
 <p>There's a vigorous debate about that. Last year, the Securities and Exc=
hange Commission told its staff to investigate the banks' claims that mark-=
to-market caused the financial meltdown. The staff produced a densely footn=
oted study that ran to 209 pages, the conclusion of which could be boiled d=
own to a single word: baloney. The banks' fundamental problem, it said, was=
 that their sloppy mortgage standards produced a lot more defaults than the=
y bargained for.</p>              <p>Others, including a study group headed=
 by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, agree with the bankers th=
at mark-to-market is the right way to value the activity of your trading fl=
oor but not a bank's core business of borrowing short and lending long.</p>=
              <p>The Financial Accounting Standards Board, an independent b=
ody that sets standards for U.S. companies, has already signaled that it wi=
ll relax the rule in April, in time for the banks' first-quarter financial =
reports. FASB says it will allow bankers to use &quot;significant judgment&=
quot; in valuing assets where no active market exists.</p>              <p>=
But revamping the rule still leaves uncertainty about what should go in its=
 place. The nation's big banks grossly overvalued their mortgage assets for=
 years; no one doubts that billions in write-downs still lie ahead. Mark-to=
-market was supposed to be an antidote for their tendency to, well, lie.</p=
>              <p>&quot;The credibility and acumen of management has been r=
aked over the coals,&quot; observes Robert Willens, a former executive of L=
ehman Bros. who consults privately on financial and tax matters.</p>       =
       <p>The bankers promise that this time, they'll be perfectly transpar=
ent about how they value their toxic assets -- that they'll apply rigorous =
projections of expected default rates and income streams and that they'll s=
how their scratch paper. Some in the industry, like former FDIC honcho Isaa=
c, believe the process will allow them to write up the value of assets they=
've overwritten down.</p>              <p>FASB's announcement suggests the =
bankers are almost certain to be given the chance to show they've reformed,=
 like a purse-snatcher turned out on the street with a stern warning from a=
 lenient judge. The economy needs them filling the role of good corporate c=
itizens. Will they seize the opportunity to behave, or go back to their old=
 ways and mug the first old lady they come across?</p>              <p>--</=

ad>            <body>              <p>As Washington's anti-bonus zeal inten=
sified Friday, alarm spread across Wall Street that the government's sudden=
 taxation fervor could ensnare thousands of workers and affect every major =
financial firm.</p>              <p>Although the fast-moving legislative ca=
mpaign was born of frustration with the bonuses paid to workers at ailing A=
merican International Group Inc., employees at comparatively healthy invest=
ment banks fretted about the steep tax hikes they could face if the legisla=
tion became law.</p>              <p>A bill passed Thursday by the House wo=
uld impose a 90% levy on bonuses paid to workers whose household incomes to=
p $250,000 by firms that received more than $5 billion under the government=
's financial rescue package. That would encompass much of Wall Street, incl=
uding such marquee-name firms as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Goldman Sachs=
 Group Inc.</p>              <p>And new proposals sprouted Friday on Capito=
l Hill as some lawmakers said the measure passed the day before didn't go f=
ar enough.</p>              <p>Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) said he w=
as preparing legislation that would impose a 70% surtax on all pay -- not j=
ust bonuses -- above $500,000 a year at major companies that received bailo=
ut funds.</p>              <p>And a prominent labor union official wrote co=
ngressional leaders asking for legislation to recoup $3.6 billion in bonuse=
s paid by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., most of which wouldn't be taxed under th=
e House-passed bill because nearly all of the payouts were made last year.<=
/p>              <p>On Wall Street, where outsized pay is a significant att=
raction, staffers worried that Congress could rewire a compensation system =
that dates back decades, to the days when the firms were private partnershi=
ps and bonuses served as a form of profit-sharing.</p>              <p>The =
rush to taxation only heightened the anxiety of an industry enduring its mo=
st arduous period in decades.</p>              <p>For the firms in comparat=
ively good shape, most employees thought they had survived the worst of the=
 financial crisis, said Jeanne Branthover, head of the financial-services p=
ractice at Boyden Global Executive Search in New York.</p>              <p>=
&quot;Yes, they may be earning less and be working harder, but they were OK=
,&quot; she said. &quot;And now, anything could happen. People in New York =
at every firm are worried.&quot;</p>              <p>Top executives -- fear=
ing an exodus of talent to smaller firms, hedge funds or foreign banks that=
 wouldn't be subject to the tax legislation -- scrambled Friday to calm emp=
loyees and lobby Congress.</p>              <p>Jes Staley, head of JPMorgan=
's asset-management division, told the unit's staff in an e-mail that the c=
ompany's executives and government-relations team were &quot;working hard o=
n all of the challenges we are currently facing.&quot;</p>              <p>=
In a memo to the staff at Citigroup Inc., Chief Executive Vikram Pandit wro=
te, &quot;I want you to know that we are working in every appropriate way .=
 . . to ensure that we can pay our employees fairly, reflecting their marke=
t value and hard work, especially during these challenging times.&quot;</p>=
              <p>A special tax on the industry's employees, Pandit wrote, &=
quot;would affect countless numbers of people who will find it difficult, i=
f not impossible, to pay back the bonuses that they earned.&quot;</p>      =
        <p>The outlook for enactment of the House legislation was not clear=
 at week's end. Leading members of the Senate Finance Committee were propos=
ing a much lower tax -- 35% -- on bonuses.</p>              <p>The chairwom=
an of labor federation Change to Win, Anna Burger, wrote to lawmakers of bo=
th parties late Friday, thanking the House for its measure and calling for =
swift action to block the Merrill Lynch bonuses.</p>              <p>&quot;=
I applaud this effort to recover these hard-earned taxes from funding anoth=
er vacation home for financial buccaneers responsible for displacing millio=
ns from home and job,&quot; she wrote. &quot;Without an amendment, however,=
 a 2008 bonus booty 20 times greater than at AIG will remain safe.&quot;</p=
>              <p>Sherman said his proposal would include the bonuses at Me=
rrill Lynch, which became part of Bank of America Corp. on Jan. 1.</p>     =
         <p>Scott Talbott of the Financial Services Roundtable, a trade org=
anization, cautioned in an interview that broad legislation limiting compen=
sation &quot;could have a chilling effect on participation in future and cu=
rrent government recovery efforts.&quot;</p>              <p>Asked about bo=
nuses for executives of firms that accept government aid, he said such firm=
s &quot;should incur those expenses that will add value to the company and =
the government's investment therein. For executives, all forms of compensat=
ion have been slashed as they are committed to restoring the economy.&quot;=

tched Excess on Wall Street</p>              <p>By William D. Cohan</p>    =
          <p>Doubleday, 468 pages, $27.95</p>              <p>It seems almo=
st achingly quaint to recall those warm and hazy days when &quot;banker&quo=
t; was a synonym for sobriety and propriety -- a time when those who worked=
 in finance, as well as those who reported on it, believed that a pinstripe=
d suit connoted one thing and a chalk stripe something else entirely.</p>  =
            <p>Anyone who still retains such antique illusions will lose th=
em fewer than 10 pages into &quot;House of Cards: A Tale of Hubris and Wret=
ched Excess on Wall Street,&quot; William D. Cohan's masterfully reported a=
ccount of the collapse of Bear Stearns, the investment banking house whose =
implosion a year ago signaled the beginning of the worst global financial c=
risis since the Great Depression.</p>              <p>Cohan, a former senio=
r investment banker who has turned into one of our most able financial jour=
nalists, is the author of 2007's &quot;The Last Tycoons,&quot; a highly reg=
arded history of Lazard Freres &amp; Co., Wall Street's most storied invest=
ment bank. In this new book, he deploys not only his hands-on experience of=
 this exotic corner of the financial industry, but also a remarkable gift f=
or plain-spoken explanation. That's essential, because it may be that only =
quantum physics defies the descriptive powers of ordinary language quite so=
 completely as the derivatives markets whose meltdowns have devastated Wall=
 Street.</p>              <p>The other great strength of this important boo=
k is the breadth and skill of the author's interviews. Essentially, with pa=
uses for needed explanation, he has used them to construct a staccato narra=
tive of the frantic 10 days in March 2008 that began with the first doubts =
about Bear Stearns' liquidity and ended when the Federal Reserve and U.S. T=
reasury forced the company to sell itself at a fire-sale price to JP Morgan=
 Chase. That and the subsequent bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the sale of =
Merrill Lynch, the collapse of insurance giant AIG and the virtual incapaci=
tation of much of the banking sector, including behemoths Bank of America a=
nd Citibank, marked the end of Wall Street's second Gilded Age and the onse=
t of the current global financial crisis.</p>              <p>At the time o=
f its collapse, Bear Stearns was one of the world's largest and most aggres=
sive investment banks, securities traders and brokerage companies. It emplo=
yed more than 15,000 people in offices around the world and, just a year ea=
rlier, Fortune had recognized it as &quot;America's most admired securities=
 firm.&quot; It also was the company most heavily invested in various forms=
 of mortgage-backed securities, the novel financial instruments that subseq=
uently sucked the world financial system down into a whirlpool of illiquidi=
ty, as American real estate inflation slowed and, then, declined.</p>      =
        <p>Crisis came to Bear Stearns when analysts and other Wall Street =
players began to raise questions about the liquidity implications of the hu=
ge positions in mortgage-backed securities -- particularly subprime mortgag=
es -- that it was carrying on its books. One of the things Cohan points out=
 is that numerous analysts, including the respected Meredith Whitney, had f=
or some years warned that the trade in credit default swaps and various mor=
tgage-backed instruments was setting the stage for &quot;a credit implosion=
&quot; that &quot;could begin a domino effect of corporate insolvencies.&qu=
ot; Welcome to our pain, circa 2009.</p>              <p>Cohan does a brill=
iant job of sketching in the eccentric, vulgar, greedy, profane and coarse =
individuals who ignored all these warnings to their own profit and the ruin=
 of so many others. It's impossible to do justice to his reportorial detail=
 in a brief review, but suffice to say it's slightly horrifying to learn th=
e importance bridge played in Bear Stearns' internal culture.</p>          =
    <p>The company's last chief executive, Alan Schwartz, is philosophical =
about the collapse of his company. He can afford to be; he was paid $35,734=
,220 in cash less than a year before Bear Stearns' forced sale. As he sees =
it, he could have done a better job of running his business, but -- in the =
end -- &quot;it was a team effort. We all [messed] up. Government. Rating a=
gencies. Wall Street. Commercial banks. Regulators. Investors. Everybody.&q=
uot;</p>              <p>Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, now =
81 and an economic adviser to President Barack Obama, candidly admitted to =
a recent gathering of Nobel laureates and high-level investors that &quot;e=
ven the experts don't quite know what's going on&quot; in the global econom=
y.&quot;</p>              <p>While the precise structural causes of the cur=
rent catastrophe still may be obscure, Volcker said he was confident that w=
e won't &quot;revert to the kind of financial system we had before the cris=
is.&quot; The future, he predicted, will hold not only more stringent regul=
ation of the entire banking system -- particularly with regard to risk mana=
gement -- but also of hedge and equity funds. To the remaining Wall Street =
smart guys who argue that re-regulation will stifle the &quot;creativity&qu=
ot; of the American financial sector, the sober old central banker had a di=
smissive rejoinder: The most heralded of these financial &quot;innovations&=
quot; -- including credit default swaps and asset-backed securities of the =
sort that brought Bear Stearns and so many others down -- have created litt=
le but fees for their originators.</p>              <p>The only banking &qu=
ot;innovation&quot; that has been of real importance to the vast majority o=
f people over the last three decades, Volcker pointed out, is the automatic=
 teller machine.</p>              <p>As Cohan's remarkable new work of fina=
ncial journalism shows, the current mess began when the investment bankers =
began to treat everyone else's finances like their private ATM.</p>        =

p>Although accounts at the time were insured only up to $100,000, Hodgson e=
nded up recovering $230,000 because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. cov=
ered half of uninsured deposits.</p>              <p>Still, she was among a=
n estimated 10,000 depositors who lost $270 million in deposits when IndyMa=
c collapsed under the weight of mortgage loan defaults.</p>              <p=
>These losses might have been prevented had federal regulators done their j=
obs in overseeing IndyMac, a government report this week determined.</p>   =
           <p>The report from the Treasury Department's inspector general e=
xcoriated the Office of Thrift Supervision for ignoring warning signs that =
IndyMac's loan portfolio was quicksand, costing the Federal Deposit Insuran=
ce Corp. $10.7 billion.</p>              <p>The report casts a shadow over =
both the OTS and its director, John M. Reich, who stepped down Friday.</p> =
             <p>&quot;John Reich's reign was catastrophic to the OTS, the F=
DIC and the uninsured depositors in particular,&quot; said Richard Newsom, =
a retired FDIC and California state bank examiner, referring to the failure=
s of IndyMac, Washington Mutual Bank and other institutions. Reich declined=
 to comment for this story. OTS officials said that Reich, after taking off=
ice in 2005, increased the number of bank examiners and worked hard to make=
 sure that struggling thrifts recovered their footing and stayed in busines=
s.</p>              <p>The Times found that those efforts were too little, =
too late in the case of IndyMac.</p>              <p>* OTS officials became=
 concerned about IndyMac's strength in early 2007, said Timothy T. Ward, OT=
S Deputy Director for Examinations, Supervision and Consumer Protection. He=
 said officials moved up a scheduled bank exam for IndyMac, but the review =
did not begin until January 2008.</p>              <p>* IndyMac's top manag=
ers tried to secure OTS approval of another questionable accounting maneuve=
r in the company's final months, according to company e-mails, before persu=
ading the agency to allow it to backdate a capital infusion, a move that is=
 now the subject of a federal investigation.</p>              <p>* The OTS =
ignored concerns from the FDIC that the bank was using recklessly high inte=
rest rates to lure in new deposits to cover its losses, interviews and docu=
ments show.</p>              <p>IndyMac prospered during the real estate bo=
om, which fueled demand for its so-called alt-A mortgages, loans that it gr=
anted to borrowers with clean credit but with little or no documentation of=
 their income. It would then sell those loans to other banks or investors t=
hrough bundled securities.</p>              <p>As the real estate market co=
llapsed, however, IndyMac was stuck with loans it couldn't sell.</p>       =
       <p>&quot;The secondary market for mortgage-backed securities had dri=
ed up,&quot; said Ward.</p>              <p>Ward said the review the agency=
 conducted in January 2008 resulted in a downgrade of IndyMac's status, put=
ting it one step away from being labeled a &quot;troubled institution.&quot=
;</p>              <p>At the same time, the OTS allowed IndyMac to make a m=
ajor change in its books that kept it from insolvency.</p>              <p>=
Instead of continuing to carry more than $10 billion in loans that no inves=
tors would buy, it moved those loans to its &quot;held for investment&quot;=
 portfolio.</p>              <p>Had it been forced to acknowledge that thes=
e loans were never going to be profitable, it would have had to report that=
 its losses were more than six times larger than its operating capital.</p>=
              <p>&quot;No honest regulator would permit a bank to cover tha=
t up, but OTS had become complicit with IndyMac,&quot; said William Black, =
a law professor at the University of Missouri at Kansas City and a former O=
TS attorney.</p>              <p>By the end of March 2008, more than half o=
f all the bank's money was coming from loans it was getting from the federa=
l government and short-term, high-interest deposits from middlemen called &=
quot;brokered deposits.&quot;</p>              <p>The brokered deposits wer=
e so crucial to IndyMac staying in business that the bank fought hard to ke=
ep them coming.</p>              <p>In order to meet the threshold that all=
owed it to continue receiving brokered deposits, it lobbied the OTS to rece=
ive a waiver allowing it to remove certain costs associated with reverse mo=
rtgages from its books.</p>              <p>&quot;I believe we have a lot o=
f levers to pull and we will be a survivor of this period, but it is not gu=
aranteed -- nothing in life is,&quot; IndyMac CEO Michael W. Perry wrote in=
 an e-mail to employees on April 17, 2008. &quot;I strongly believe that we=
 retain our positive regulatory relationship with the OTS and it is in the =
FDIC's strong financial interest to work with us.&quot;</p>              <p=
>That same month, rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded IndyMac's =
securitized mortgages and, at that point, the bank should have been declare=
d short of cash, the inspector general said.</p>              <p>On May 6, =
the FDIC told OTS regional managers that IndyMac was close to failing and n=
eeded new money -- quickly.</p>              <p>&quot;FDIC was very concern=
ed,&quot; its spokesman Andrew Gray said. &quot;And our analysis led us to =
a conclusion that IndyMac needed between $1 [billion] and $3 billion in add=
itional capital to survive.&quot;</p>              <p>On May 9, IndyMac man=
agers made this pitch to Darrell Dochow, the head of the thrift agency's we=
stern region: Let IndyMac accept an $18-million deposit from its holding co=
rporation that day but book it as if it had occurred before the end of the =
first quarter.</p>              <p>In doing so, IndyMac would meet an impor=
tant FDIC threshold and be allowed to accept more brokered deposits and hig=
h-interest retail deposits</p>              <p>Dochow agreed to IndyMac's p=
roposal. The bank stayed &quot;well capitalized&quot; and was allowed to co=
ntinue bringing in deposits for another two months.</p>              <p>In =
a Jan. 30 letter to Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, Reich said that=
 IndyMac's independent auditors and the FDIC also knew about the backdating=
 plan and &quot;raised no objections.&quot;</p>              <p>FDIC offici=
als countered that the agency had asked OTS about the late deposit and was =
told that IndyMac had a &quot;note receivable,&quot; essentially a promise =
for the $18 million that had been given to it prior to March 31, 2008.</p> =
             <p>&quot;That turned out to be misinformation,&quot; Gray said=
.</p>              <p>An IndyMac spokesman declined to comment.IndyMac, mea=
nwhile, went fishing for more deposits. Its rate on a one-year certificate =
of deposit went from 2.35% in May to 4.05% in July. The average at the time=
 was 2.45%. Shortly before being seized, it was offering 4.1% yield for a s=
ix-month CD.</p>              <p>Those rates alarmed the FDIC.</p>         =
     <p>&quot;We became concerned that the bank was paying interest rates w=
hich appeared to exceed the limitations prescribed in FDIC regulations appl=
ying to banks that were less than well capitalized,&quot; Gray said.</p>   =
           <p>OTS, in its role as the lead examiner, could have stopped the=
 bank from offering those high rates.</p>              <p>But IndyMac was a=
llowed to bring in at least $90 million in new uninsured deposits from peop=
le like Hodgson, right before it collapsed.</p>              <p>--</p>     =

         <p>A major fundraiser for former Gov. Rod Blagojevich has stepped =
down as the head of Mutual Bank, a key financial institution in Chicago's I=
ndian community that gave the banker significant sway and fundraising power=
 in Chicago's biggest political circles.</p>              <p>Amrish Mahajan=
, 62, submitted his resignation this month, said David Laffee, the bank's c=
hief financial officer and interim president.</p>              <p>Mahajan's=
 resignation comes as his wife, Anita, awaits trial on nearly 2-year-old ch=
arges that her drug-testing company ripped off taxpayers for more than $2 m=
illion in work it never performed under a state contract.</p>              =
<p>The Mahajans also have come under scrutiny from federal authorities inve=
stigating connections between Blagojevich campaign donors and state busines=
s doled out by his administration. A family attorney said Wednesday that Ma=
hajan's resignation had nothing to do with the ongoing investigation of Bla=
gojevich. Officials with Mutual Bank's board did not return calls for comme=
nt.</p>              <p>But the resignation comes weeks after federal and s=
tate banking regulators alleged that Mutual had &quot;unsafe and unsound ba=
nking practices and had violated laws or regulations.&quot;</p>            =
  <p>Mahajan raised at least $500,000 for Blagojevich, and Anita Mahajan hi=
red Patricia Blagojevich on several real estate deals that netted the first=
 lady more than $113,000 in commissions. The connections created questions =
because Mutual Bank had regulatory business before the state and Anita Maha=
jan's drug-testing business, K.K. Bio-Science, had a long-standing no-bid s=
tate contract.</p>              <p>Following reports of the deals by the Tr=
ibune, the Cook County state's attorney's office charged Anita Mahajan with=
 bilking millions from state taxpayers.</p>              <p>----------</p> =

          <body>              <p>Dear Government,</p>              <p>If yo=
u had asked me a year ago if I thought I could land a job as CEO of a huge,=
 trillion-dollar bank, I would have said, &quot;No way, dude.&quot; Back th=
en, from what I could tell from commercials, it was all about online checki=
ng and stagecoaches and other stuff I don't know anything about. Back then,=
 I was also less about CEOing than commercial watching.</p>              <p=
>But this &quot;bad bank&quot; job is perfect for me. Did you know that eve=
n as a kid I was such a bad banker that when someone passed &quot;go,&quot;=
 I'd just grab a wad of different colored bills and hand them to everyone? =
I'm not really a counter or a color looker.</p>              <p>Once, I sto=
od in line at Citibank for 15 minutes, and when I got to the front of the l=
ine, I asked for a chalupa. Boy, was I wasted.</p>              <p>My other=
 relevant banking experience was when I was watching that movie where they =
talk that old retired guy into doing one last heist. So I decided to call t=
his old dude who used to be my L.A. Times editor and ask him to rob Citiban=
k with me, but I fell asleep instead.</p>              <p>Here's my plan fo=
r how I'd CEO the bad bank. First, I would hook up all those security camer=
as to the Internet. Then I'd replace all the security guards' bullets with =
those little exploding dye pellets they sneak into the money they give robb=
ers, and have the guards shoot each other and play Dokken really loud. Our =
business plan wouldn't involve investments but strictly Internet advertisin=
g.</p>              <p>Because the bad bank is going to own a lot of people=
's mortgages, I'm going to institute a policy called Foreclose/Evite/Party/=
Don't Clean Up.</p>              <p>And instead of interest, we're going to=
 pay people compliments. We won't waste a lot of time keeping records, so i=
t's likely that all our assets will get mixed up with the other banks' asse=
ts. So when you go to make a withdrawal, it's possible that instead of mone=
y you'll get blood.</p>              <p>In addition to taking toxic debt fr=
om the good banks, I'd also happily take other things they're dying to get =
rid of, like Canadian coins and elderly customers. All of my upper manageme=
nt will be Icelandic.</p>              <p>Our tellers will wear the same ou=
tfits as Hooters waitresses, only instead of &quot;Hooters,&quot; the shirt=
s will say &quot;Bad Bank,&quot; which won't quite work as well, so we'll t=
ake out ads where dudes check out hot chicks and say, &quot;Check out the b=
ad bank on her,&quot; so people will get it.</p>              <p>I'm not na=
ive. I know there's going to be a bad-bank competition. Citibank, I believe=
, is trying to get rid of all its bailout money on the deal for naming righ=
ts to the new Mets stadium. I wish I'd thought of that first.</p>          =
    <p>My goal is that by year two I'm not showing up to work at all. Also,=
 to do such a tremendous job that when people say they're making bank, they=
 say it with shame.</p>              <p>If this goes as well as I hope, I'm=
 thinking we could expand into other areas, like bad dry cleaning, where we=
 will take seven or eight hours to Martinize. Sometimes we'd accidentally S=
imonize. Or be wearing your suit when you come to pick it up.</p>          =
    <p>So, please look over my resume, paying particular attention to the s=
kills-and-hobbies section, which takes up the bottom three-quarters of the =
page. That's where I talk about my ability to do body shots off both myself=
 (skill) and others (hobby).</p>              <p>I don't know what kind of =
salary a bad-bank CEO makes, so I'm hoping the government has a bad account=
ing office that scrambles numbers, like on &quot;Lost,&quot; and will assig=
n a really high salary for the job.</p>              <p>Feel free to contac=
t any of my references, both of whom owe me money from football games we be=
t on.</p>              <p>Let's make it the baddest bank ever!</p>         =
     <p>Sincerely,</p>              <p>Joel Stein</p>              <p>--</p=

    <p>In one of three U.S. bank failures Friday, regulators closed Allianc=
e Bank of Culver City and sold its five branches to California Bank &amp; T=
rust.</p>              <p>The San Diego-based buyer agreed to assume all of=
 Alliance Bank's deposits, including uninsured funds, so no depositors will=
 lose money as a result of the bank's failure, the Federal Deposit Insuranc=
e Corp. said.</p>              <p>When the bank reopens Monday, depositors =
automatically will become customers of California Bank &amp; Trust and will=
 continue to have deposit insurance coverage of at least $250,000, the FDIC=
 said.</p>              <p>Alliance customers can write checks and use debi=
t cards over the weekend and should pay their loans as usual, but customers=
 of both banks should use only their current branches until California Bank=
 &amp; Trust integrates Alliance's deposit records, the agency said.</p>   =
           <p>Alliance, which got into trouble lending to home builders, ha=
d $1.14 billion in assets and $951 million in deposits on Dec. 31.</p>     =
         <p>In addition to assuming Alliance's deposits, including those ma=
de through brokers, California Bank &amp; Trust agreed to buy most of the C=
ulver City bank's loans, sharing losses on them with the FDIC.</p>         =
     <p>The FDIC estimated that the failure would cost the deposit insuranc=
e fund $206 million. The agreement with California Bank &amp; Trust, a subs=
idiary of Zions Bancorp of Utah, was the least costly resolution compared w=
ith alternatives, the agency said.</p>              <p>Also Friday, regulat=
ors shut down County Bank of Merced, Calif., with WestAmerica Bank of San R=
afael, Calif., agreeing to take over its 39 branches, $1.3 billion in depos=
its and $1.7 billion in assets.</p>              <p>The FDIC, which will sh=
are losses with WestAmerica, said the failure would cost its insurance fund=
 $135 million.</p>              <p>Earlier Friday, regulators closed FirstB=
ank Financial Services of McDonough, Ga., whose deposits and four offices w=
ere taken over by Regions Bank of Birmingham, Ala.</p>              <p>Alli=
ance and County were the eighth and ninth banks to fail in the nation this =
year, and the second and third in California. Redlands' 1st Centennial Bank=
 collapsed Jan. 23.</p>              <p>Alliance, which earned $9.4 million=
 in 2006 and $5.4 million in 2007, lost $98 million last year.</p>         =
     <p>On Oct. 15, the FDIC and the California Department of Financial Ins=
titutions classified it as undercapitalized and ordered it to raise $30 mil=
lion in capital.</p>              <p>The bank, with branches in Culver City=
, Irvine, Woodland Hills, Burbank and West Los Angeles, was owned by Allian=
ce Bancshares California.</p>              <p>The holding company's shares =
closed Friday at 15 cents, unchanged for the day. The stock peaked at $18 a=
 share in February 2007 and traded above $7 as recently as a year ago.</p> =

e Federal Reserve's latest survey of bank lending, reported Monday, showed =
that a majority of banks made it harder to get loans in the last three mont=
hs -- although in some loan categories the percentage tightening credit was=
 down from the Fed's October survey.</p>              <p>A net 64% of domes=
tic banks said they tightened lending standards on commercial and industria=
l loans to large and mid-size companies in the last three months, down from=
 the 84% that said they had tightened in the October survey. A year earlier=

in the last three months, compared with 75% in the October survey.</p>     =
         <p>Even if they weren't otherwise tightening loan standards, most =
banks were raising the rates they charge for credit, the Fed said.</p>     =
         <p>&quot;Around 90% of domestic banks indicated that they had incr=
eased spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds&quot; for commercial a=
nd industrial loans, the survey found. &quot;Likewise, very large fractions=
 of banks reported having charged higher premiums on riskier loans and havi=
ng increased the costs of credit lines to firms of all sizes over the surve=
y period.&quot;</p>              <p>Commercial real estate lending standard=
s were tightened by 79% of domestic banks, compared with the 87% that repor=
ted making loans harder to get in the October survey.</p>              <p>C=
onsumers with good credit may have found it somewhat easier to get a mortga=
ge: The percentage of lenders tightening standards on prime home loans fell=
 to 47% in the latest survey from 69% in the previous survey.</p>          =

<body>              <p>Bankers don't have a lot of fans these days. Their c=
redit requirements have risen, they are stingy with loans and they aren't p=
aying much on deposits. On top of that, they suffer from their association =
with the likes of John Thain, former head of Merrill Lynch, who lavished mo=
ney on bonuses and office furniture in his last months, and Kenneth Lewis, =
chief executive of Bank of America, which took over Merrill but let Thain g=
et away with all that.</p>              <p>But the real problem doesn't lie=
 with the perverse instincts of the people running our financial institutio=
ns. It lies with the bad debt they took on, particularly in untried mortgag=
e-backed securities, during the real estate boom of recent years.</p>      =
        <p>The boom has turned into a bust, sharply reducing the value of t=
hese assets and casting uncertainty over the condition of the banks. So the=
y have been less willing to lend to each other or to anyone else, and the e=
conomy has struggled to overcome the shortage of credit.</p>              <=
p>One component of any broad recovery has to be putting the banking sector =
on a solid footing. That was the idea back in September, when the Treasury =
Department proposed a $700 billion plan, which was supposed to rescue banks=
 by purchasing assets that had lost value. But faced with spreading turmoil=
, Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke decided=
 instead to use the first $350 billion installment mainly to invest in bank=
s to shore up their capital base.</p>              <p>But recapitalization =
is worrisome, both because it means the federal government is now part owne=
r of what are supposed to be private, capitalist institutions, and because =
pressure from powerful politicians reportedly has played a significant role=
 in deciding which banks get help. Not to mention that the capital injectio=
ns didn't banish the paralyzing uncertainty created by the bad paper.</p>  =
            <p>So now the Obama administration apparently is returning to t=
he original idea behind TARP -- cleaning up bank balance sheets by relievin=
g them of these securities. The model is the Resolution Trust Corp., which =
was set up to take on and eventually sell off the assets of insolvent savin=
gs and loans in the 1980s.</p>              <p>One proposal reportedly bein=
g considered is to set up a &quot;bad bank&quot; that would buy mortgage-ba=
cked assets and hold them until they can be sold at something higher than t=
oday's fire-sale prices. If it works as intended, it will restore confidenc=
e in the financial sector and induce them to start lending again. And it av=
oids the perils of partial or full nationalization.</p>              <p>The=
 downside is that taxpayers would be liable if the bad bank eventually has =
to sell these assets for less than it paid. But if the change invigorates t=
he economy, it will probably buoy their value. It's almost certainly cheape=
r to absorb this potential expense than to live with the status quo indefin=
itely.</p>              <p>A sound economy requires a sound banking system.=
 After the experience of the last few months, Americans should need no conv=
incing on that point.</p>            </body>          </html></Text></p><p =

<title></title>            </head>            <body>              <p>The de=
epening recession is at least partly a product of a prolonged crisis in cre=
dit markets. Major banks have cut back on lending, unable or unwilling to p=
art with their deposits. Even banks that have received billions of dollars =
in fresh capital from Washington have been slow to lend. That's because the=
ir balance sheets, like those across the financial industry, are tainted by=
 investments in complex securities that almost no one wants to buy, most of=
 them tied to bundles of mortgages with rising default rates. Illiquid and =
losing value, these assets make it hard to judge a bank's health. That unce=
rtainty, in turn, makes it difficult for banks to raise money for new loans=
 and investments.</p>              <p>The Bush administration sought to att=
ack this problem in the fall with a new, $700-billion Troubled Asset Relief=
 Program to buy the banks' dicey holdings. It never followed through on tha=
t idea, but now the Obama administration is considering a similar approach =
that could be even more expensive. One plan being floated would have the go=
vernment create a &quot;bad bank&quot; that would acquire troubled assets f=
rom commercial banks, insurance companies and segments of the credit market=
. The strategy is aptly named, because it's a bad idea.</p>              <p=
>--</p>              <p>A sale without price tags</p>              <p>Like =
the original TARP, the bad-bank idea has some merit. Rather than unloading =
assets (which might include securitized car loans and credit card debt in a=
ddition to mortgage-related investments) at fire-sale prices, this bank wou=
ld wait for markets to recover, then sell them gradually. The theory is tha=
t many of the assets have real value, which would become easier to divine o=
ver time as foreclosures ebb and the economy rebounds. Meanwhile, scraping =
the sludge off lenders' books would eliminate much of the mystery about the=
ir condition, enabling credit markets to return to normal and hastening the=
 end of the recession.</p>              <p>There are a couple of precedents=
 for this approach. Mellon Bank used a bad-bank spinoff to recover from a n=
ear-death experience in the late 1980s. About the same time, Washington cre=
ated the Resolution Trust Corp. to sell the questionable assets held by fai=
ling savings and loans. The RTC ended up costing taxpayers about $75 billio=
n, a sum that looks like chump change today. And in the early 1990s, Sweden=
 used a bad bank to clear a glut of debts from that country's financial ins=
titutions.</p>              <p>The biggest problem, though, is the same one=
 that led the Bush administration to not use the TARP as planned. As benefi=
cial as it may be to create a market for illiquid securities, it's well-nig=
h impossible to determine the right price to pay for them. They're almost c=
ertainly worth a lot less than the value recorded on their owners' books, b=
ut they may very well be worth more than the prices they'd command in a dis=
tress sale today. Although banks have already written down some of their ho=
ldings, analysts estimate that U.S. banks face an additional trillion dolla=
rs in losses from failing assets this year. The government could buy troubl=
ed assets in a reverse auction -- paying the price sought by the lowest bid=
der -- but then the most desperate players would set the price for a catego=
ry of securities, forcing banks holding similar assets to make excessive an=
d potentially disastrous write-downs. On the other hand, if the government =
paid the book value of the assets, taxpayers would be the ones to absorb lo=
sses that could prove to be enormous.</p>              <p>Then there's the =
moral hazard. Even if the government managed the assets deftly enough to av=
ert losses, most of the financial gains that resulted from the maneuvering =
would go to the banks that were liberated from their mistakes. Giving taxpa=
yers a preferred stake in any institution that sells toxic assets to the go=
vernment could mitigate the problem, but that might drive off investors by =
raising fears of a total government takeover. Just look at what's happened =
to the share prices of the banks that took money from the TARP.</p>        =
      <p>--</p>              <p>Doing nothing is not an option</p>         =
     <p>Economists have pointed to several other ways to nurse financial ma=
rkets back to health. One possibility is to have the government help launch=
 &quot;good banks&quot; that could attract capital and lend money. The main=
 drawbacks are the time it would take them to become significant players an=
d the specter of the government picking winners and losers (not that it has=
n't been doing that already). Another idea is to have the feds take over al=
l or part of the banking industry, wiping out shareholders. Although it sol=
ves the moral hazard problem, that would be an alarming departure from the =
country's free-market system.</p>              <p>We think the best idea is=
 for the government to guarantee a portion of the value of the questionable=
 assets, rather than buying them outright. The government wouldn't have to =
figure out the true worth of those securities. The guarantees would erect a=
 floor under a bank's holdings, making it easier for the bank to attract ca=
pital and strike deals. The weakest banks would be exposed and would likely=
 fail; the stronger ones would endure losses before the federal guarantees =
kicked in, while also having to pay taxpayers for that insurance.</p>      =
        <p>It's also clear that solving the asset problem is just one piece=
 of the puzzle. As we've said before, keeping more borrowers out of foreclo=
sures is crucial because it addresses the root of the financial-market mala=
ise. So too is stimulating the broader economy. Although the cost is daunti=
ng -- one analyst put a $3.5-trillion price tag on an asset cleanup effort =
-- it's less than the impact of a banking-system breakdown. A recent study =
by economists Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff found three common s=
trains in financial crises since 1899: prolonged and deep drops in housing =
and stock prices; lengthy and &quot;profound&quot; declines in gross domest=
ic product and jobs (with unemployment rising 7 percentage points on averag=
e); and skyrocketing government debt. Those &quot;debt explosions&quot; wer=
en't caused by bank bailouts, they wrote, but by the collapse in tax revenu=
es caused by the downturns and the increase in government spending on stimu=
lus programs. As discomfiting as it may be to guarantee some risky banking =
industry bets, the alternative is far, far worse.</p>            </body>   =

          <body>              <p>What America needs is another bad bank, an=
d it may get one in the months ahead.</p>              <p>This &quot;bad ba=
nk&quot; would be a creation of the Obama administration, conceived as a du=
mping ground for some of the garbage stinking up the nation's financial ins=
titutions.</p>              <p>The government ultimately would bear the cos=
t of those dud loans and toxic derivatives, which explains why bank stocks =
rose sharply Wednesday -- and why critics worry this could be the most expe=
nsive bad bank ever.</p>              <p>The idea has been kicked around fo=
r months, and it's not obvious why it came to the fore again Wednesday.</p>=
              <p>Its leading supporter is Sheila Bair, chair of the Federal=
 Deposit Insurance Corp., which guarantees bank accounts and probably stand=
s to manage the bad bank.</p>              <p>Bair would draw on federal TA=
RP funds as well as private-equity investments. Banks selling their least-d=
esirable assets would receive some kind of stock in the bad bank, as well a=
s cash to replenish their balance sheets.</p>              <p>The bad bank =
would step in as a buyer of last resort, with the wherewithal to hold on un=
til business conditions improve. It also would manage mortgages to keep mor=
e Americans in their homes.</p>              <p>At heart, the bad bank repr=
esents a compromise between the current ad-hoc approach and a sweeping nati=
onalization of the financial industry.</p>              <p>The idea echoes =
a similar toxic landfill established during the savings and loan restructur=
ing of the 1980s. But the Resolution Trust Corp. took over the assets and l=
iabilities of failed institutions.</p>              <p>This one, evidently,=
 is intended to help banks that regulators otherwise might seize and liquid=
ate.</p>              <p>A lifeline would spare the bankers pain but it als=
o would create &quot;moral hazard&quot; -- the notion that shielding people=
 from their mistakes makes them all the more reckless. If this bad bank abs=
olves financial sinners, look out below.</p>              <p>To get credit =
moving again, however, the risks might be worth it, some business leaders s=
ay. After all, nothing else has worked so far.</p>              <p>At the I=
nland Real Estate Group in Oak Brook, vice chairman Joe Cosenza is optimist=
ic about the plan -- as long as it has what he calls &quot;the hook.&quot;<=
/p>              <p>For every dollar in additional capital from Uncle Sam &=
amp; Co., the banks should be required to use most of it in new loans.</p> =
             <p>&quot;You really have to get the money going. It is sitting=
 in banks right now, doing nothing,&quot; said Cosenza, a real estate and b=
anking veteran. &quot;That money should be put out on the street.&quot;</p>=
              <p>The funding, he said, would avert bankruptcies and layoffs=
 resulting solely from the credit crunch.</p>              <p>But at least =
a few bankers see a more complicated dynamic.</p>              <p>At Itasca=
-based First Midwest Bancorp, Chief Executive Michael Scudder said he belie=
ves a government-run bad bank could reduce the pressure on capital levels, =
encouraging more lending. But business conditions and prudent underwriting =
standards could work against it. &quot;You end up with competing forces,&qu=
ot; he said.</p>              <p>Appearing at a downtown real estate confer=
ence with Cosenza earlier this week, First Midwest executive Kenneth Kadlec=
k noted that lending makes sense only if borrowers put the money to good us=
e.</p>              <p>&quot;Where is the good deal to put that money?&quot=
; Kadleck asked.</p>              <p>That's a good bank talking.</p>       =
       <p>For a bad bank eager to get money moving again at all costs, the =
sky's the limit.</p>              <p>----------</p>              <p>gburns@=

 <body>              <p>John Ryan is a banker hoping for some help from the=
 federal government, which is not surprising in the current financial crisi=
s, except that he doesn't make loans.</p>              <p>He makes wetlands=
.</p>              <p>Ryan, 52, is a wetland banker, a pioneer in an obscur=
e industry of entrepreneurs who create or restore wetlands, then sell &quot=
;credits&quot; to agencies and developers that are required to offset what =
they destroy.</p>              <p>Wetland banking, which got its start loca=
lly in St. Charles, was thriving amid an explosion of suburban growth over =
the last two decades. But as the economy, particularly the housing market, =
has collapsed, wetland banking has largely dried up.</p>              <p>Wh=
ile the lull has concerned wetland bankers, some environmentalists say the =
slowdown has bought them time to protect remaining wetlands and push for ch=
anges to wetland banking, which they say is not achieving its purpose of re=
placing what is lost.</p>              <p>Wetlands serve several ecological=
 functions. In addition to serving as a habitat for dozens of different spe=
cies of plants and birds, they help control flooding, filter pollution and =
replenish the water supply.</p>              <p>Yet their importance was la=
rgely ignored until 1989, when President George H.W. Bush ordered that agen=
cies and developers replace wetlands they damage so there is &quot;no net l=
oss.&quot;</p>              <p>To meet this directive, many developers simp=
ly tried to build new wetlands on site, which often failed to create an att=
ractive wildlife habitat.</p>              <p>&quot;Developers don't know h=
ow to build wetlands,&quot; said Jeff Mengler, a wetland ecologist for the =
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. &quot;They put them out back of local shopp=
ing centers or whatever, and that's not really the best place for them.&quo=
t;</p>              <p>Wetland bankers say they not only make life easier f=
or developers, but they also  perform an environmental service by replacing=
 low-quality wetlands with high-quality wetlands strategically located to b=
enefit watersheds.</p>              <p>Typically, bankers excavate land and=
 remove drain tiles from farmlands that historically were wetlands. Then, w=
hen the ground becomes soggy, they install native plants such as sedges and=
 rushes, remove invasive species and seek approval from federal agencies to=
 sell more credits.</p>              <p>In 1994, Ryan became the nation's f=
irst private wetland banker when he established Otter Creek Wetland Mitigat=
ion Bank in St. Charles, which served as a model for a growing industry. Th=
ere are now at least 16 active wetland banks across the Chicago region.</p>=
              <p>By 2005, there were more than 400 banks nationwide, accord=
ing to the Environmental Law Institute. Today, wetland banking is a nearly =
$3 billion industry, with credits in the Chicago area ranging from $50,000 =
to more than $100,000 per acre of restored wetland.</p>              <p>But=
 as the housing market froze up, wetland banking has slowed dramatically. S=
ome of Ryan's former clients -- home builders such as Kimball Hill Homes an=
d Neumann Homes Inc. -- have filed for bankruptcy.</p>              <p>On a=
 recent morning, he adjusted water levels beneath the snow-covered Lily Cac=
he Wetland Bank in Bolingbrook.</p>              <p>Ryan, whose company, La=
nd and Water Resources Inc., owns several wetland banks, said his sales las=
t year were down 80 percent from an average year.</p>              <p>&quot=
;When the economy is down, banking credits aren't moving, just like cars ar=
en't moving,&quot; he said.</p>              <p>Steve Weller, owner of EcoL=
ogic Planning Inc., which owns several wetland banks in Lake and McHenry Co=
unty, said business dropped about 50 percent last year. He said credit sale=
s were particularly weak in far-flung suburbs, where a spike in gas prices =
last year further slowed development.</p>              <p>With sales of cre=
dits largely frozen, critics see an opportunity to make changes to wetland =
banking. Some environmentalists say too little is known about the long-term=
 success of the wetlands they create or restore.</p>              <p>And in=
 some cases, wetland banks actually lead to the loss of more wetlands. In 2=
006, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency found that banks in the state=
 led to a loss of 123 to 247 acres over a 10-year period, with some banks l=
ittle more than ponds without vegetation.</p>              <p>&quot;The ide=
a that something that takes decades to form can easily be replaced by human=
s may reflect some unwarranted optimism,&quot; said Jessica Wilkinson, a se=
nior policy analyst at the Environmental Law Institute.</p>              <p=
>Environmentalists now have an opportunity to protect as many wetlands as t=
hey can, mainly by acquiring land, Wilkinson said.</p>              <p>In t=
he Chicago suburbs, developers are approaching forest preserve districts, o=
ffering to sell them pieces of land because they aren't able to develop the=
m in the current economy, Mengler said.</p>              <p>But wetland ban=
king could make a comeback. Bankers are hopeful about a proposed economic s=
timulus package making its way through Congress that calls for building new=
 roads and bridges, which often impact wetlands.</p>              <p>And on=
ce the economy improves -- and commercial and housing development bounces b=
ack -- a new rule introduced last year by federal officials is expected to =
bolster the industry by encouraging developers to buy credits from banks in=
stead of trying to rebuild wetlands on site. &quot;It's unfortunate that th=
e downturn came right when banking got a nice shot in the arm,&quot; Ryan s=
aid. &quot;But I believe once the economy gets straightened out, it's going=
 to be a delayed boom.&quot;</p>              <p>----------</p>            =

       <p>CORRECTION: SEE CORRECTION APPENDED; Crocker Club: An article in =
Friday's Calendar about the Crocker Club in downtown L.A. said Vincent Terz=
ian is its sole owner. Thomas Turner is a co-owner of the lounge.</p>      =
        <p>What's the safest night-life bet in 2009? For downtown dwellers,=
 it might just be inside an old bank.</p>              <p>The loft-leasing =
crowd has had its eye on the old Crocker Citizens National Bank Building (a=
t 5th and Spring streets, now the Spring Arts Tower) ever since word leaked=
 out years ago that the basement of the building would eventually become a =
lounge.</p>              <p>Beginning next week (after private parties this=
 weekend), drinking inside an honest-to-God bank vault will finally become =
a reality at a regal new bar that invokes the name of one of California's m=
ost historically prominent families, the Crocker Club.</p>              <p>=
&quot;This has been a labor of love,&quot; says the basement lounge's owner=
, Vincent Terzian.</p>              <p>No kidding. Terzian has spent the be=
tter part of two years inside the 6,000-square-foot lounge; obsessing over =
every detail of the historic location in order to dazzle patrons with its m=
ultiple bars and spaces.</p>              <p>&quot;If anyone can find a det=
ail I missed, drinks are on me,&quot; the 35-year-old joked while inside th=
e Crocker's Mosler Lounge space, which lies behind a massive 1960s-era stai=
nless steel bank-vault door manufactured by the Mosler safe company.</p>   =
           <p>It would have been nearly impossible to remove the vault, so =
Terzian built around the chamber, joining a growing number of bars and rest=
aurants nationwide that have taken over old banks, such as Manhattan haunt =
Trinity Place, Minneapolis' B.A.N.K. restaurant and San Jose's Vault Ultra =
Lounge. But the transformation did involve a long struggle.</p>            =
  <p>&quot;The challenges we faced in terms of construction stem from the f=
act it was a basement project,&quot; he said.</p>              <p>It remain=
s to be seen whether the Crocker Club can emulate the success of nearby riv=
als, such as the still-popular Edison on 2nd Street and the Association on =
6th Street, but Terzian's timing appears good: Retro cocktail culture, whic=
h fits the Crocker and its design scheme perfectly, is blossoming all over =
L.A.</p>              <p>&quot;This bar is all about nostalgia, but with an=
 edge,&quot; Terzian said.</p>              <p>Deep inside the club, at the=
 bottom of Crocker's staircase, patrons are greeted with a handsome mahogan=
y bar that echoes several other area nightspots, such as the Doheny and the=
 Edison.</p>              <p>But what immediately catches the drinker's eye=
 is the club's piece de resistance: the Mosler Lounge. Dramatically set ins=
ide the old vault, the Mosler is like a bar within a bar.</p>              =
<p>&quot;The vault door still closes,&quot; Terzian says. &quot;We even bro=
ught a specialist in to make sure it can function. He was blown away, espec=
ially when he saw the floor job we installed inside the vault.&quot; But re=
st assured, Terzian won't be locking anyone in, or out, of the Mosler Loung=
e.</p>              <p>Just outside the vault, a series of semiprivate boot=
hs that used to be for examining safe deposit boxes lines a hallway, little=
 hideaways for parties of two to 20. Behind that series of booths lies the =
entrance to the Crocker's Ghost Bar, featuring hand-painted ceilings that e=
voke the grandeur of a 1930s-era bar. And, if you believe Terzian, this par=
t of the Crocker is haunted.</p>              <p>The manager of the Spring =
Arts Tower, Kevin Taylor, backs up Terzian's claim, saying many in the buil=
ding, including himself, have seen spirits all over the building.</p>      =
        <p>&quot;I get reports of haunting periodically,&quot; says Taylor.=
 &quot;We get a lot of 'transparent man' sightings on the ninth floor, and =
I've heard a lot of stories about the basement from production companies th=
at have shot down there.&quot; (The first two &quot;Rush Hour&quot; films a=
nd several commercials have been shot in the Spring Arts Tower.)</p>       =
       <p>But it's likely most patrons of the Crocker Club will be making t=
he trek to the Bank District watering hole for spirits of a different kind =
in 2009. It's a sophisticated experience, right down to the custom ice cube=
s. But whatever you do, don't compare the Crocker Club to a New York bar.</=
p>              <p>&quot;I'm a native, and this is an Angeleno bar,&quot; T=
erzian says. &quot;Everybody more or less seems to think that this is what =
a bar would be like in New York or other parts of the country, but the Croc=
ker Club is a Los Angeles establishment.&quot;</p>              <p>And you =

title>            </head>            <body>              <p>Two of the coun=
try's biggest banks spilled billions of dollars in fresh red ink Friday, pr=
ompting further erosion of stock prices in the financial sector.</p>       =
       <p>Bank of America Corp. reported a $2.6-billion quarterly loss, mar=
king its first loss in 18 years. The company also practically eliminated it=
s dividend, as required by the latest federal aid package announced Thursda=
y night by the government that includes a new $20-billion capital infusion.=
</p>              <p>Citigroup Inc. posted an $8.3-billion loss for the qua=
rter and said it eventually planned to sell or spin off much of the company=
 beyond its traditional banking business and investment bank.</p>          =
    <p>The ugly results underscore the depth of the problems plaguing the i=
ndustry, said Jeff Arricale, manager of the T. Rowe Price Financial Service=
s mutual fund.</p>              <p>&quot;The U.S. banking system is on life=
 support,&quot; he said. &quot;Things are bad and haven't bottomed yet.&quo=
t;</p>              <p>Bank of America's stock tumbled 14% on the news, whi=
le Citigroup's sank 8.6%. An index of bank stocks slid 4.1%, giving it a lo=
ss of 21% for the week.</p>              <p>Last fall, Bank of America seem=
ed to be weathering the worst economic storm since the Depression. It was p=
aying a hefty 64-cent-per-share quarterly dividend, and it agreed to buy Ne=
w York-based brokerage giant Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., rescuing it from what=
 appeared to be likely failure.</p>              <p>In October, the Charlot=
te, N.C., bank said it didn't need its first $25-billion infusion from the =
government -- including $10 billion allocated to Merrill -- but accepted it=
 nonetheless.</p>              <p>But Friday the company cut its dividend t=
o a penny a share as a condition of its second federal infusion of capital.=
 As part of the aid package, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. agreed to =
share losses on $118 billion of toxic assets held by the company, most of t=
hem taken on when the Merrill Lynch deal closed Jan. 1.</p>              <p=
>BofA Chairman Kenneth D. Lewis said the government stepped in this week be=
cause Merrill's condition had deteriorated drastically in the last four mon=
ths. The company said the brokerage lost $15.3 billion in the fourth quarte=
r, before its books were meshed with Bank of America's.</p>              <p=
>The FDIC determined that not helping Bank of America &quot;would have sign=
ificant and systemic effects on the broader economy,&quot; said agency spok=
esman Andrew Gray.</p>              <p>Such a determination, the only way t=
he FDIC can assist open banks, requires approval from the Federal Reserve a=
nd the Treasury secretary in consultation with the president, Gray said.</p=
>              <p>In addition to slashing its dividend, Bank of America wil=
l have to submit its executive pay decisions for government approval. The b=
ank earlier this month said it wouldn't pay bonuses for 2008 to Lewis or ot=
her top executives.</p>              <p>As a fee for the loss-sharing arran=
gement, Bank of America agreed to give the Treasury and the FDIC an additio=
nal $4 billion of preferred stock paying an 8% dividend.</p>              <=
p>Citigroup said it planned to shed its CitiFinancial consumer-finance unit=
 and its Primerica insurance business. This week Citi said it was putting i=
ts vaunted Smith Barney brokerage in a joint venture to be controlled by ri=
val Morgan Stanley.</p>              <p>The moves amount to the most drasti=
c attempt yet by the beleaguered banking giant to stem losses that totaled =
$18.7 billion last year and more than $28 billion in the last five quarters=
. The company is essentially abandoning its longtime &quot;financial superm=
arket&quot; strategy of providing virtually every financial service imagina=
ble under one roof.</p>              <p>&quot;Our results released this mor=
ning are clearly disappointing, and I can assure you that my No. 1 priority=
 is to return this company to profitability,&quot; said Vikram Pandit, Citi=
group's chief executive, in a conference call with analysts.</p>           =
   <p>&quot;It's hard for people who are not here to truly understand the m=
agnitude of change we've gone through,&quot; Pandit said.</p>              =
<p>Critics had long derided the financial supermarket concept as unworkable=
, saying customers wouldn't necessarily buy insurance or brokerage services=
 from their banker, and complained that the company had grown too unwieldy =
to manage properly.</p>              <p>&quot;They're rationalizing the siz=
e of the company and putting resources where resources should go and gettin=
g rid of things that just don't fit well with the rest of the pieces,&quot;=
 said Anton Schutz, a money manager specializing in financial stocks.</p>  =
            <p>Pandit promised that Citigroup would return to profitability=
 this year and be in the black for the year as a whole.</p>              <p=
>But the company still faces daunting obstacles, starting with the crippled=
 economy that is causing vicious loan losses throughout the banking industr=
y.</p>              <p>Beyond that, it's unclear whether Citigroup can find=
 buyers or fetch reasonable prices for the businesses it hopes to unload. T=
here also are questions about how profitable a more risk-averse Citigroup w=
ill be.</p>              <p>As word of the restructuring leaked out this we=
ek, some critics said that it didn't go far enough and that Citigroup would=
 have to rend itself apart further.</p>              <p>--</p>             =

ing the depths of the problems in the banking sector, two of the nation's l=
argest financial-services companies reported substantial losses Friday and =
took dramatic steps to try to shore up their businesses.</p>              <=
p>Bank of America Corp., posting its first loss since 1991 and cutting its =
dividend to a penny from 32 cents, will receive emergency government funds =
to support the acquisition of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Meanwhile, Citigroup =
Inc. announced its latest attempt to become profitable again: splitting the=
 bank into two pieces.</p>              <p>Bank of America: The Bush admini=
stration agreed to provide it with an additional $20 billion in support fro=
m the government's $700 billion financial rescue fund. Bank of America agre=
ed to pay a dividend on the cash injection and will accept more restriction=
s on executive pay.</p>              <p>The administration, the Federal Res=
erve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. also agreed to participate in =
a program to provide guarantees against losses on approximately $118 billio=
n in various types of loans and securities backed by residential and commer=
cial real estate loans.</p>              <p>The lifeline, coupled with a $1=
.79 billion fourth-quarter net loss, put more pressure on Chief Executive K=
enneth Lewis to make the takeovers of Merrill Lynch and mortgage lender Cou=
ntrywide Financial Corp. pay off. Lewis has drawn criticism from analysts f=
or rescuing the two ailing companies, and the bank told investors on a conf=
erence call to expect more and possibly bigger losses in the quarters ahead=
.</p>              <p>Bank of America already had been granted $25 billion =
from the bailout fund that Congress passed on Oct. 3, but found it needed m=
ore as it sought to cope with rising losses related to its acquisition of M=
errill Lynch.</p>              <p>Citigroup: After suffering a loss of $8.2=
9 billion, its fifth straight quarterly deficit, the giant institution is r=
eorganizing into Citicorp and Citi Holdings. The first will focus on tradit=
ional banking around the world, while the second will hold the company's ri=
skier assets and tougher-to-manage ventures.</p>              <p>CEO Vikram=
 Pandit's move should reduce operating costs and allow Citigroup to sell or=
 spin off Citi Holdings assets to raise cash. It also reveals the company's=
 growing focus on back-to-basics lending and deposit-gathering, and dismant=
les the &quot;financial supermarket&quot; created a decade ago.</p>        =
      <p>But investors, stung by years of instability at the company, were =
wary about the move. Whether it marks the start of a recovery or a massive =
fire sale depends on some unpredictable factors -- like the economy, the ma=
rket, and the government.</p>              <p>&quot;We are looking at a liq=
uidation here,&quot; said Christopher Whalen, managing director of Institut=
ional Risk Analytics.</p>              <p>Credit: FROM TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE=

itle>            </head>            <body>              <p>Can a $400-milli=
on injection of federal bailout money to the &quot;bank to the stars&quot; =
in Beverly Hills really help revive the troubled U.S. economy?</p>         =
     <p>That's one of the questions the Treasury Department's inspector gen=
eral is asking in a review of the decision to award bailout funds to City N=
ational Bank, The Times has learned.</p>              <p>The inspector gene=
ral's examination of the funding for City National reflects growing concern=
 in Washington about whether the banking bailout is working. In a private m=
eeting Dec. 10, top financial regulators, including Treasury Secretary Henr=
y M. Paulson, acknowledged the difficulty of keeping track of the massive f=
unding and measuring its effects on the economy, according to documents rel=
eased Wednesday.</p>              <p>The inquiry is not based on any suspec=
ted wrongdoing by City National. Instead, investigators see the review as a=
 case study into how the Treasury Department is implementing its controvers=
ial program to infuse $250 billion into the nation's banking system and why=
 certain institutions were selected to participate.</p>              <p>The=
 program was launched at the peak of the financial crisis in October to str=
engthen banks and encourage them to lend money, thawing the freeze that has=
 deepened the yearlong recession. But critics are questioning the effective=
ness of the effort and whether bureaucrats can ensure that the money will a=
ctually be used to make loans.</p>              <p>So far, the Government A=
ccountability Office and the Congressional Oversight Panel for Economic Sta=
bilization have issued reports skeptical of the ability of the program to h=
elp the general economy and critical of the Treasury Department for not pub=
licly explaining how it doles out taxpayer funds.</p>              <p>The n=
ew inquiry by Treasury Department Inspector General Eric Thorson takes a mo=
re focused examination of a single firm -- City National. The Beverly Hills=
 institution is among 209 banks that have so far received a total of $162 b=
illion in bailout money.</p>              <p>In a statement to The Times, t=
he inspector general's office said it wanted to know &quot;specifically how=
 financial institutions are determined to be eligible for participation&quo=
t; and that it was &quot;looking at the application and selection of one in=
stitution based in Southern California.&quot;</p>              <p>The state=
ment, issued by Richard Delmar, counsel to the inspector general, did not n=
ame the bank. But City National was identified as the target of the inquiry=
 in briefings on Capitol Hill last month, according to congressional offici=
als who were not authorized to discuss the matter.</p>              <p>With=
 more than $12 billion in deposits, City National is the largest bank based=
 in Los Angeles County. It has long been known as the &quot;bank to the sta=
rs&quot; because it provides wealth-management services for entertainment i=
ndustry figures. About 19% of its commercial loans go to the industry.</p> =
             <p>City National has said it was encouraged to apply for the b=
ailout funds (which was first reported in late October as $395 million) and=
 that there was no indication that it did anything wrong in seeking the mon=
ey.</p>              <p>When the bank announced that it would get the funds=
, Chief Executive Russell Goldsmith said it would create a &quot;fortress b=
alance sheet that will reassure our clients and attract new clients.&quot;<=
/p>              <p>The inquiry has caught bank officials by surprise.</p> =
             <p>&quot;We're not aware of any such review,&quot; spokeswoman=
 Debora Vrana said. &quot;As we've said before, the Treasury Department inv=
ested $400 million in City National as part of a broader plan to inject cap=
ital into some of the nation's strongest financial institutions. This inves=
tment is a vote of confidence in City National.&quot;</p>              <p>B=
ut experts outside the Bush administration are uncertain that the cash inje=
ctions are helping the economy. The $250-billion banking bailout is the lar=
gest component of the $700-billion federal Troubled Asset Relief Program.</=
p>              <p>Richard H. Neiman, superintendent of banks for the state=
 of New York and a member of the Congressional Oversight Panel that is prob=
ing the bailout, said nobody knew yet whether banks were hoarding the capit=
al or using it to make loans.</p>              <p>A tension exists in the s=
ystem now because banks fear the consequences of making bad loans in a rece=
ssion, even while they are getting federal money and being exhorted to expa=
nd lending, Neiman said.</p>              <p>&quot;It was a missed opportun=
ity for the Treasury not to impose greater criteria and expectations to tho=
se banks receiving the funds, as well as greater reporting requirements to =
understand how the funds are being used,&quot; he said.</p>              <p=
>It is also questionable whether the massive program is helping local commu=
nities. In mid-December, bankers, economists and business leaders in hard-h=
it Las Vegas told a hearing of the Congressional Oversight Panel that they =
had not seen any positive effect.</p>              <p>Treasury officials, h=
owever, have contended from the start that the program is intended to make =
healthy banks healthier.</p>              <p>&quot;Our purpose is to increa=
se confidence in our banks and increase the confidence of our banks, so tha=
t they will deploy, not horde their capital,&quot; Secretary Paulson said i=
n announcing the program Oct. 20. Since then, Treasury officials have plead=
ed for patience to allow the plan time to unfold.</p>              <p>The T=
reasury Department process for awarding the funds, however, seems opaque. B=
anks applying for the funds -- in some cases billions of dollars -- have on=
ly to fill out a two-page form.</p>              <p>Each bank request goes =
to the regulator for that segment of the industry, such as the Office of Th=
rift Supervision for savings and loans. A recommendation then goes to the T=
reasury Department's Office of Financial Stabilization, and a closed-door c=
ommittee decides who gets money. The 209 banks that have received funds are=
 a tiny fraction of the roughly 8,000 banks in the nation.</p>             =
 <p>Regulators have declined to say how many applications have been filed o=
r the percentage that has been approved.</p>              <p>&quot;The proc=
ess is confidential,&quot; said a spokesman for the Comptroller of the Curr=
ency, which regulates national banks.</p>              <p>Huge capital inje=
ctions were made to Wells Fargo &amp; Co., JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Citigr=
oup Inc. and Bank of America Corp., among many other household names. The c=
ontroversial effort was intended to restore confidence in the banking syste=
m.</p>              <p>&quot;People often ask: How do we know our program i=
s working? First, we did not allow the financial system to collapse,&quot; =
Neel Kashkari, chief of the Office of Financial Stabilization, told Congres=
s on Dec. 10.</p>              <p>City National's $400-million capital inje=
ction was the second largest among the 33 banks in California that have rec=
eived funds through Dec. 22, according to the most recent Treasury transact=
ion report. A total of $27.3 billion was given to California institutions, =
led by $25 billion for San Francisco-based Wells Fargo.</p>              <p=
>City National lacks a broad consumer banking network. The bank's identific=
ation with wealthy clients, its headquarters in Beverly Hills and its assoc=
iation with an industry that is often viewed by outsiders as quirky may hav=
e played some part in why it was singled out for a review.</p>             =
 <p>But its strong balance sheet exactly fits the profile of a bank that th=
e Treasury Department wants to pour money into.</p>              <p>&quot;W=
e firmly believe that healthy banks of all sizes should use this program to=
 continue making credit available in their communities,&quot; Kashkari told=
 a House committee in December.</p>              <p>In a televised intervie=
w last month, City National CEO Goldsmith said the federal program was cutt=
ing down on fear, and he criticized people who expected instant results.</p=
>              <p>&quot;You don't lend out $400 million in two weeks,&quot;=
 he told CNBC.</p>              <p>--</p>              <p>ralph.vartabedian=

   <body>              <p>Gideon Gono prints money, lots and lots of money =
that's worth next to nothing. Depending on whom you talk to, the architect =
of Zimbabwe's hyperinflation is a megalomaniac, a workaholic, a thief -- or=
 the country's savior.</p>              <p>Zimbabwe's central bank chief se=
ems to have a finger in every government ministry. No project goes ahead wi=
thout his approval. No underling approaches without fear and trembling.</p>=
              <p>He makes no apologies for his furious money-printing, as t=
he country, mired in disease and hunger, inflation beyond calculation and p=
olitical crisis, keeps on spiraling downward. Extraordinary situations call=
 for extraordinary measures, he says.</p>              <p>The 49-year-old f=
ormer tea boy, target of Western economic sanctions and confidant of Presid=
ent Robert Mugabe has made more enemies in the ruling ZANU-PF party than an=
y other senior member. And some people think he may be its weak link. But f=
or now, it's his obsession with photo ops and his autocratic control over g=
overnment affairs that dominate.</p>              <p>One pro-ZANU-PF banker=
 shudders while recalling Gono's summons of top banking officials to his of=
fice in early December. It was a made-for-television ambush. As the cameras=
 rolled, Gono berated the bankers for releasing new bank notes a day before=
 their launch.</p>              <p>They weren't even his employees, but he =
fired them anyway. On television. But Gono wasn't done with them. The lobby=
 was full of police waiting to arrest them when their elevator opened on th=
e ground floor.</p>              <p>&quot;I had to sleep on the floor in th=
e cell,&quot; the banker said, deeply shaken, two days after his release on=
 bail. &quot;I've never slept on the floor in my life. There was water drip=
ping everywhere.&quot; He spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of jeopa=
rdizing his trial.</p>              <p>As pressure on Gono has grown with t=
he collapse of Zimbabwe's economy, he has blamed banks, the stock exchange,=
 black market currency dealers and insurance companies. As well as firing t=
he bankers, he blacklisted 20 investment companies and froze their accounts=
.</p>              <p>As a survival tactic, it has worked. Despite the high=
est inflation rate on Earth, estimated by independent economists in at leas=
t quadrillions of percents, Mugabe recently reappointed Gono for another fi=
ve-year term. It sparked as much outrage in the ZANU-PF as it did in the op=
position.</p>              <p>&quot;Not only is he destroying the country, =
he is destroying the party,&quot; growled one senior ZANU-PF official.</p> =
             <p>Gono employs florid, indignant rhetoric and wears a large, =
flashy gold watch. When he strides into the bank at his usual breakneck pac=
e in the morning, there's a flurry of panic. A security guard who fails to =
open the door before Gono reaches it faces certain punishment and possible =
dismissal, according to one Reserve Bank manager. The manager, who like oth=
ers interviewed for this story, is afraid of getting fired and spoke on con=
dition of anonymity.</p>              <p>Gono usually works until midnight.=
 Under his leadership, the Reserve Bank has taken on myriad tasks unrelated=
 to central banking: buying government cars, supplying farm equipment and f=
ertilizer, setting up and supplying &quot;People's Shops&quot; to sell chea=
p goods, setting up foreign currency shops, supplying medicines to state ho=
spitals, mobilizing rigs to drill bore holes for clean water in the cholera=
 crisis and a biofuels project, to name a few.</p>              <p>&quot;He=
's now like the head of state. He's reaching almost everything,&quot; the m=
anager said.</p>              <p>&quot;People fall over each other to pleas=
e him and some get hurt in the process, and he likes that. He likes that at=
tention. He likes power,&quot; said another Reserve Bank employee. &quot;He=
's very vindictive. He can hold a grudge for weeks.&quot;</p>              =
<p>Like Mugabe, Gono blames Zimbabwe's ills on Western sanctions. U.S. and =
European countries imposed bans on senior officials, preventing them from t=
raveling to or doing business with the West. Gono is among those under sanc=
tions.</p>              <p>The Times requested a phone interview with Gono =
but did not receive a response.</p>              <p>Rejecting what he calls=
 &quot;traditional&quot; economics (like the principle that printing money =
endlessly causes runaway inflation), he contends that printing money is act=
ually a form of &quot;sanctions busting.&quot;</p>              <p>&quot;I =
must reiterate that I am going to print and print and sign the money until =
sanctions are removed and there is balance-of-payments support. It's a comm=
itment I am ready to be fired for because we need money for infrastructural=
 development,&quot; Gono said, quoted in the government-owned Herald on Oct=
. 1.</p>              <p>But the senior ZANU-PF official scoffs at that arg=
ument. &quot;If the money was being provided to build hospitals, schools an=
d roads, it might be sanctions busting. But it's being used for conspicuous=
 consumption. Everywhere you go there are Mercedeses.&quot;</p>            =
  <p>Gono's own website, www.gideongono.com, gives a taste of the Reserve B=
ank governor's ego, charting his course from tea boy and cleaner at a provi=
ncial brewery to becoming one of the most powerful men in the country.</p> =
             <p>But Gonogonow.com, a website run by activists, offers a sen=
se of how loathed he is. It (and his enemies in ZANU-PF) accuse him of mass=
ive looting of state finances, claims he has denied.</p>              <p>Th=
e activists print anti-Gono fliers in English and Shona and target people s=
tanding in line at banks to withdraw money. They feature cartoons of Gono l=
oading Reserve Bank money into the back of cars or gulping down feasts, usu=
ally with his foot on a child's skeleton.</p>              <p>&quot;IT'S YO=
UR MONEY -- TAKE IT NOW!&quot; screams one flier.</p>              <p>&quot=
;IF GONO STAYS WE WILL ALL DIE!&quot; bellows another.</p>              <p>=
&quot;Gono is the weak link in the Mugabe regime because he's become incred=
ibly powerful and incredibly bloated, and he's got very few friends in the =
system,&quot; said one activist involved in the project, who spoke anonymou=
sly for fear of reprisals. &quot;No ministry can get access to cash without=
 going to Gono. He controls everything. He's become this power-mad individu=
al who's loathed by the whole country.&quot;</p>              <p>He said ot=
her members of the group regarded the GonoGoNow project as their most dange=
rous anti-regime activity. &quot;They think Gono would kill over this,&quot=
; said the activist.</p>              <p>Gono recently launched his book, &=
quot;Zimbabwe's Casino Economy,&quot; dashed off in 60 days. In an economy =
where most U.S. dollar transactions are banned, his book is priced at $40.<=
/p>              <p>Tony Hawkins, an independent Harare-based economist who=
se citation awarding Gono an MBA distinction is appended, these days descri=
bes Gono's performance as &quot;disastrous.&quot;</p>              <p>&quot=
;We've got to the point where his policy seems to be living from day to day=
 and making sure there's cash. There's no policy, there's no strategy, ther=
e's no direction, there's nothing,&quot; said Hawkins.</p>              <p>=
But Gono sees himself as the country's shepherd. Blaming him for the econom=
y, he said, &quot;is the worst form of diabolical nonsense and the highest =
form of intellectual naivete and dishonesty . . . only matched by a hyena t=
rying to tell a flock of sheep that the worst enemy is their shepherd,&quot=
; according to a report in the Herald on Sept. 30.</p>              <p>Befo=
re he went to the Reserve Bank, Gono had a reputation as a solid banker. In=
 2003, Hawkins warned Gono not to take the Reserve Bank job because it woul=
d destroy him.</p>              <p>Hawkins remembers: &quot;He said, 'No, I=
'm going to sort everything out.' &quot;</p>              <p>--</p>        =

corner of the nation's mortgage meltdown and credit crisis, it's hard to fi=
nd anybody who sees evidence that the Treasury Department's $700-billion re=
scue plan is working after two months.</p>              <p>In the first pub=
lic hearing of the Congressional Oversight Panel -- a three-member board ma=
ndated to keep close watch on the bailout program enacted in October -- eco=
nomists, local bankers, beleaguered homeowners and government officials sai=
d here Tuesday that the billions of dollars paid out by Washington to the b=
anking industry were not filtering down and that Nevada's desperate conditi=
on was growing worse.</p>              <p>Clark County has the nation's hig=
hest foreclosure rate. Unemployment has jumped above 7% and lines for free =
food at charity centers are growing.</p>              <p>&quot;It is a sad =
day when a child writes to Santa that all she wants for Christmas is food,&=
quot; said Julie A. Murray, who operates the Three Square food bank.</p>   =
           <p>She was one of the approximately 150 people who attended the =
hearing on the campus of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.</p>          =
    <p>The government's solution to the crisis was to bolster the nation's =
banking system by handing out about $250 billion to scores of banks.</p>   =
           <p>But &quot;there is little evidence of what effect these billi=
ons of dollars are having on us,&quot; said Elizabeth Warren, the Harvard U=
niversity law professor who chairs the panel.</p>              <p>Warren ha=
s repeatedly asked Treasury Department officials for an explanation of thei=
r strategy and how the bailout is supposed to help solve the credit crisis,=
 but so far her panel has not received any answers.</p>              <p>The=
 same issues are being raised by the Government Accountability Office and T=
reasury Department Inspector General Eric Thorson.</p>              <p>Demo=
crat Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader, said at the hearing =
that major banks were failing to increase lending, despite getting most of =
the first $350 billion allocated.</p>              <p>&quot;It is just not =
helping at all,&quot; Reid said.</p>              <p>Before Congress gives =
the Treasury approval for the second $350 billion of the rescue plan, Reid =
said in an interview, he intends to tighten restrictions on how the money i=
s spent.</p>              <p>The senator said he intended to make sure that=
 additional spending is targeted to help families in foreclosure. Reid said=
 the exact plan will depend on recommendations from Warren's panel, which i=
s supposed to provide monthly reports to Congress and advise it on regulato=
ry reforms.</p>              <p>In a later interview, Warren said the Treas=
ury Department should have a lot of leverage to compel banks to do more, gi=
ven that taxpayers have handed over billions of dollars and in many cases a=

     </head>            <body>              <p>Already fuming over a worldw=
ide financial crisis they blame on Wall Street, European banks are alarmed =
that U.S. investment manager Bernard L. Madoff could have cost them billion=
s more dollars through fraud.</p>              <p>Some of the biggest banks=
 in Spain, France and Britain acknowledged Monday that they had significant=
 exposure to funds tied to Madoff. U.S. authorities say the celebrated trad=
er, once considered a paragon of integrity, duped clients from around the w=
orld into buying into what was essentially an enormous Ponzi scheme, on the=
 promise of impressive returns.</p>              <p>Spanish banking giant S=
antander said it had invested about $3.1 billion in Madoff's firm. In Brita=
in, two household names in retail finance, the Royal Bank of Scotland and H=
SBC, revealed that together they could lose about $1.6 billion. And Natixis=
, a French bank, pegged its exposure at as much as $600 million.</p>       =
       <p>Such potential losses would add insult to the injury already deal=
t to European financial institutions as a result of the worldwide credit cr=
unch and the meltdown of the global banking system. The Royal Bank of Scotl=
and has been particularly battered in recent months and partially nationali=
zed by the British government to keep it from going under.</p>             =
 <p>Spain's economy minister, Pedro Solbes, and the governor of the Bank of=
 Spain, Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez, both expressed surprise Monday that=
 U.S. regulators had not detected the alleged scam earlier and called for r=
eforms of the monitoring system.</p>              <p>But Fernandez Ordonez =
described the effect of the scandal on the Spanish banking sector as minima=
l compared with the effects of the global financial meltdown.</p>          =

Executive Kenneth Lewis says it's not uncommon for an institution to experi=
ence shrinking levels of deposits in a market during the first year of an a=
cquisition.</p>              <p>In October 2007, Bank of America bought LaS=
alle Bank, which had been the Chicago area's second-biggest deposit gathere=
r, behind JPMorgan Chase.</p>              <p>Their combined market share i=
n the Chicago area has shrunk from 14.5 percent as of June 2007 to 13.3 per=
cent in June 2008, the latest period for which figures are available from t=
he Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Similarly, deposits of Bank of America a=
nd LaSalle have dropped 7.5 percent, to $36.15 billion, over the same time =
frame.</p>              <p>&quot;Usually we'll find a pocket of deposits th=
at we don't solicit because they're too high priced or they're brokered dep=
osits,&quot; Lewis explained last week when asked about the deposit drop in=
 the Chicago area.</p>              <p>Typically, banks pay higher interest=
 rates on brokered certificates of deposit, which they acquire through brok=
ers, than on non-brokered CDs.</p>              <p>But the local bleeding c=
ould stop by the time 2009 numbers are reported.</p>              <p>&quot;=
As we see things now, our deposit growth is probably three times the indust=
ry average nationwide, and we're experiencing the same thing here because t=
here's this flight to quality in these tough times,&quot; Lewis said after =
speaking last week at the Executives Club of Chicago. &quot;If you look at =
June this year to June next year, you'll see a whole different story&quot; =
in Chicago-area deposit levels.</p>              <p>But Lewis said last wee=
k he's &quot;very satisfied&quot; with the LaSalle deal.</p>              <=
p>&quot;It went almost exactly like we thought,&quot; he said.</p>         =
     <p>Lewis isn't the first to claim that deposits can take a downturn in=
 a market after an acquisition.</p>              <p>Last month, when announ=
cing the purchase of National City Corp., PNC Financial Services Group Inc.=
 CEO James Rohr discussed how his bank, like Bank of America, also rejigger=
s the loans and deposits of newly merged operations.</p>              <p>Ta=
ke the state of Maryland, where PNC became a bigger player when it bought M=
ercantile Bankshares Corp. in 2007.</p>              <p>&quot;That process =
so far resulted in a 9 percent decline in average loans as we implemented o=
ur moderate-risk profile standards and began reducing higher-risk commercia=
l and commercial real estate development loan positions,&quot; Rohr said in=
 a conference call last month.</p>              <p>PNC also had nearly a 30=
 percent drop in average deposits in its new Maryland business as it &quot;=
chose to run off higher-cost interest rate CDs,&quot; he said.</p>         =
     <p>&quot;Instead, our focus has been growing customers, growing core c=
hecking relationships that increased 4 percent during this time,&quot; Rohr=
 said. &quot;It is not unusual to see a decrease in core customer relations=
hips following an acquisition, so we are pleased with the increases we are =
seeing in this market.&quot;</p>              <p>----------</p>            =

    </head>            <body>              <p>Federal regulators seized Dow=
ney Savings &amp; Loan and PFF Bank &amp; Trust late Friday, saying hundred=
s of millions of dollars in bad loans from the housing bubble had rendered =
the Southern California banking fixtures unsound.</p>              <p>The b=
anks' branches will continue operating as usual under the ownership of Minn=
eapolis-based U.S. Bank, one of the country's largest banks, and no deposit=
ors will lose any money because of the failures, regulators said.</p>      =
        <p>Newport Beach-based Downey lost $547.7 million in the first nine=
 months of 2008, largely because of risky &quot;option ARM&quot; mortgages =
-- adjustable-rate loans that let borrowers pay so little each month that t=
heir loan balances rose.</p>              <p>PFF, short for Pomona First Fe=
deral, specialized in loans to Inland Empire developers and home builders, =
running up $289.5 million in losses in the January-September period.</p>   =
           <p>&quot;The closing of these two thrifts once again demonstrate=
s the tremendous impact of the housing market distress on the state of Cali=
fornia,&quot; John Reich, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, sai=
d in a statement announcing the seizure of the institutions.</p>           =
   <p>After seizing the banks, the agency handed them over to the Federal D=
eposit Insurance Corp., which immediately agreed to have U.S. Bank, a unit =
of US Bancorp, acquire virtually all their assets and assume all of their d=
eposits.</p>              <p>US Bancorp agreed to shoulder the first $1.6 b=
illion in losses on the two thrifts' loans. The FDIC will be on the hook fo=
r losses after that, which it estimates will be $2.1 billion.</p>          =
    <p>Of the $3.7 billion in total estimated losses, $2.9 billion is on Do=
wney's loans and $800 million is on PFF's.</p>              <p>The FDIC sai=
d it entertained other offers for the two thrifts. But the agency determine=
d US Bancorp's offer was the least costly to the federal deposit insurance =
fund, which is financed by premiums paid by banks and thrifts.</p>         =
     <p>US Bancorp, which has largely escaped the mortgage losses plaguing =
many banks, said acquiring Downey and PFF was part of its strategy of expan=
ding in the West, particularly in California, where it recently completed t=
he acquisition of Mellon Business Bank in downtown Los Angeles.</p>        =
      <p>Before the latest deals, U.S. Bank had 353 California branches, a =
modest number in contrast with the presence the bank maintains in downtown =
Los Angeles. Its name appears on the former Library Tower on Fifth Street, =
the highest U.S. skyscraper west of the Mississippi.</p>              <p>Th=
e Downey and PFF branches brings U.S. Bank's California total to 561 branch=
es, compared with more than 1,000 each for Bank of America Corp. and Wells =
Fargo &amp; Co.</p>              <p>The $2.1-billion loss brings the deposi=
t insurance fund's losses on failed banks to about $15 billion this year, s=
aid Arlington, Va., bank consultant Bert Ely.</p>              <p>Ely said =
that amount could have been far lower if regulators had stepped in earlier =
to force the operators of big thrifts like Washington Mutual Inc. and Downe=
y to find a buyer or clean up their acts before their loan problems became =
so severe.</p>              <p>&quot;It's really sad about Downey,&quot; El=
y said. &quot;It was a great institution with a great branch system and cus=
tomer base, and it made it through all the bank troubles of the 1980s. In t=
he end, it was just like WaMu. These problems are like a fresh-caught fish,=
 not like a fine red wine -- they don't get better with age.&quot;</p>     =
         <p>Downey Financial Corp., parent of Downey Savings, was co-founde=
d in 1957 by developer Maurice McAlister, a bass fisherman and nickelodeon =
collector who built shopping centers with Downey branches. McAlister remain=
ed chairman until July, when Downey's woes were already apparent.</p>      =
        <p>PFF was the oldest banking outfit based in Southern California, =
founded in Pomona in 1892 to serve towns in what was then the citrus belt. =
Parent PFF Bancorp Inc., based in Rancho Cucamonga, had hoped to sell itsel=
f to Oak Park, Ill.-based FBOP Corp., which owns California National Bank a=
nd other community banks.</p>              <p>The seizures are likely to ma=
ke permanent the disappearance of the stock market value of Downey Financia=
l and PFF Bancorp. Since the end of 2006, when the mortgage meltdown began,=
 Downey's shares have lost 99% of their value. PFF's stock is down 99.8%.</=
p>              <p>Regulators allowed Downey and PFF to complete their busi=
ness Friday before stepping in.</p>              <p>At Downey's headquarter=
s, a group of 10 FDIC and US Bancorp officials strode into the lobby of pin=
k granite and marble at 6:06 p.m. and took the elevator to the fifth-floor =
executive offices to begin the transition to new ownership.</p>            =
  <p>Downey and PFF were the 21st and 22nd FDIC-insured institutions to fai=
l this year. No. 20, a bank in Georgia, was seized earlier Friday.</p>     =
         <p>Other collapses this year have included Pasadena's IndyMac Bank=
, the largest Southern California S&amp;L, whose failure in July is expecte=
d to cost the deposit insurance fund $8.7 billion. The FDIC is operating In=
dyMac while seeking a buyer for it.</p>              <p>US Bancorp said it =
would modify home loans for struggling Downey borrowers using as a model an=
 aggressive program the FDIC has adopted at IndyMac.</p>              <p>Do=
wney and PFF's customers are better off than some of IndyMac's because all =
of their deposits were assumed by U.S. Bank. IndyMac customers whose accoun=
ts weren't fully insured haven't gotten, and may never get, access to all o=
f their money.</p>              <p>Before the announcement, Tim Stevenson, =
54, a retired construction contractor who was getting money from an ATM at =
Downey's Burbank branch, said he had considered moving his more than $80,00=
0 at Downey to another bank.</p>              <p>&quot;I heard they were hu=
rting, but what's happening to their stock is not something I wanted to hea=
r,&quot; Stevenson said. &quot;I thought they'd cranked things back up.&quo=
t;</p>              <p>Joe Schweitzer, 69, a retired teacher and a longtime=
 Downey customer in Sherman Oaks, said Friday afternoon that he had known t=
he thrift was at risk of failing.</p>              <p>&quot;I heard that th=
eir stock was below $1, that they had bad loans and that the government was=
n't going to help them,&quot; he said. &quot;But as long as my money's insu=
red, I'm not scared.&quot;</p>              <p>Still, when a certificate of=
 deposit matured two weeks ago, he and his wife transferred the money to Ci=
tibank.</p>              <p>Schweitzer said he was frustrated to learn that=
 Citibank's parent company, Citigroup Inc., had its own problems. Its stock=
 plunged 60% this week.</p>              <p>&quot;We moved the CD to Citiba=
nk, and now look at where they are in the stock market,&quot; he said. &quo=
t;They're where everyone's money is going to, but they're also in terrible =
shape. It's like jumping from one hot potato to another.&quot;</p>         =
     <p>Some Southern California banks whose stock prices have cratered con=
tinue to operate.</p>              <p>Temecula Valley Bank Chairman Stephen=
 H. Wacknitz said Friday that Temecula was not in as dire a situation as PF=
F, Downey or Vineyard Bancorp in Corona. All four banks have seen their sto=
cks punished by investors worried about the banks' loan troubles.</p>      =
        <p>Wacknitz said Temecula had stopped its high-risk lending on spec=
ulative buildings seven or eight months ago.</p>              <p>&quot;You =
show me a bank whose stock hasn't gone down,&quot; he said. &quot;Look at C=
