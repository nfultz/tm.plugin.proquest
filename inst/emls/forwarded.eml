> Family members of a 35-year-old Richton Park woman shot five times by =
her estranged husband said she had an order of protection against him =
and complained to police three weeks ago that he was harassing her, but =
nothing was done.
>=20
> Police said the order of protection had expired and that detectives =
asked Clarence Banks to come talk to them after the complaint, but he =
did not.
>=20
> Banks, 37, shot his wife Thursday and then turned the gun on himself, =
Richton Park Acting Police Chief Vito Mannino said. Banks died a few =
hours later. His wife, whose name police would not release, survived and =
was hospitalized.
>=20
> A sister, LaMonica Sims, said the woman's condition was improving and =
she was surrounded by friends and family.
>=20
> Sims said earlier police intervention could have prevented the =
shooting.
>=20
> "My problem is why didn't the police go pick him up," she said. =
Mannino said the woman reported an incident involving her husband about =
three weeks ago and that Banks was under investigation. "We'd asked him =
to come in and talk to a detective," he said. "But either we postponed =
it or he did."
>=20
> Mannino said officers told the woman not to stay at her home, but she =
didn't follow their advice.
>=20
> Police were called to the scene by residents in the Lioncrest =
Townhouse complex near 219th Street and Governors Highway. When police =
arrived, they found Banks lying on the ground and his wife was about 20 =
yards away, Mannino said. A .32-caliber semiautomatic handgun and =
numerous shell casings were recovered from the scene.

> Full text:
> Stung by the national slowdown in the residential housing market, =
Chicago-based Corus Bankshares Inc. said Friday that first-quarter net =
income dropped 39 percent and warned that the situation could worsen =
"over the next several quarters, or even years," particularly if =
problems persist in the subprime lending market.
>=20
> Shares of the company, one of the area's biggest locally based banks, =
tumbled as much as 8 percent before rallying to close at $17.27, down =
0.23 percent, on the Nasdaq stock market.
>=20
> "With a loan portfolio consisting, almost exclusively, of condominium =
construction and conversion loans, the nationwide slowdown in the =
residential housing market is impacting Corus' business," Chief =
Executive Robert Glickman said in a statement.
>=20
> The slowdown is manifesting itself through a decline in loan =
originations and therefore loans outstanding, as well as an increase in =
problem loans.
>=20
> "The current quarter's earnings declined as a result, and it would not =
surprise us to see an even greater impact on earnings over the next =
several quarters, or even years, depending on when the market improves," =
Glickman said.
>=20
> The parent of Corus Bank said it's unclear what effect problems in the =
subprime mortgage lending market, which serves consumers with spotty =
credit, will have on the company. It doesn't make, purchase or hold any =
subprime mortgages, but there could be an indirect impact because its =
customers are the condo developers who sell units to individuals.
>=20
> To the extent that subprime lenders cut back on their loans, "it is =
likely that our customers [the condo developers] may lose sales to those =
individuals who would have required a subprime mortgage to close on =
their purchase," Glickman said.
>=20
> Among the Chicago market's top 10 bank holding companies as ranked by =
deposit market share, Corus is one of only four locally headquartered =
companies. The others are Northern Trust Corp., Wintrust Financial Corp. =
and First Midwest Bancorp.
>=20
> JPMorgan Chase, LaSalle Bank, Harris Bank, Fifth Third, Charter One =
and Citibank are all owned by out-of-town companies.
>=20
> Corus said earnings fell to $26.4 million, or 46 cents a share, from =
$43.4 million, or 75 cents a share, in the first quarter of 2006. The =
latest results included a pre-tax loss of $15.3 million related to the =
decline in value of a stock investment.
>=20
> Excluding that, earnings would have been $36.3 million, or 63 cents a =
share, still a 17 percent decline from the year-ago quarter.

> Full text:
> For five of the past six years, Bangladesh's people have ranked their =
nation the most corrupt on Earth on an international graft watchdog =
list. It isn't hard to see why.
>=20
> Economists estimate that thieving politicians, including the families =
and cronies of the country's two feuding political dynasties, have =
pocketed more than $5 billion a year by taking a cut of nearly =
everything sold in the country. About $40 billion in foreign aid has =
been misappropriated over 35 years in this poor and densely populated =
delta nation, analysts say.
>=20
> In Bangladesh, judges throw cases for cash, bureaucrats sell jobs, =
businessmen run strong-arm cartels and, until recently, outgoing Prime =
Minister Khaleda Zia's eldest son, Tarique Rahman, was known as "Mr. Ten =
Percent" for his rapacious skimming.
>=20
> But this month, Mr. Ten Percent is in jailed awaiting trial, along =
with a few dozen of the country's other top politicians. His powerful =
mother is expected to head to exile in Saudi Arabia within days, rather =
than face corruption charges. And her longtime political rival, Sheikh =
Hasina, has been told that if she returns Monday as planned from an =
extended holiday abroad, she faces prosecution on corruption and murder =
charges.
>=20
> In surely one of the strangest political turnarounds in the world, =
this South Asian kleptocracy now finds itself run by a military-backed =
government took power three months ago intent on restoring democracy by =
prosecuting or exiling the nation's most powerful politicians as part of =
an unprecedented war on corruption.
>=20
> That the top two targets are women -- usually seen in aid circles as =
the less corruptible sex -- only adds to the oddness of the whole =
affair.
>=20
> "It's definitely surreal," said Iftekhar Zaman, executive director of =
the Bangladesh branch of Transparency International, the leading =
international anti-corruption watchdog that releases corruption rankings =
each year. "But this country was left with no options."
>=20
> 'Unprecedented' turnaround
>=20
> In January, Bangladesh's military declared a state of emergency in the =
moderate Muslim nation and installed a caretaker government after =
efforts to hold elections failed following violent street protests =
between supporters of the two political parties that for 15 years have =
battled for Bangladesh's political spoils.
>=20
> Since then, with enthusiastic backing from the country's fed-up =
population of 140 million, Bangladesh's new rulers have launched a =
campaign to root out political corruption as a prerequisite for holding =
new democratic elections next year.
>=20
> Poor, crowded and set on a vast flood-prone delta, Bangladesh is =
best-known for huge death tolls from seasonal cyclones and monsoons. But =
in recent decades the Iowa-sized country of rice paddies and shrimp =
farms has emerged as a perfect cauldron for graft as plundering =
politicians, greedy bureaucrats, bribe-proffering businessmen and the =
least savory of the nation's many non-profit aid groups look for a way =
to make an unearned buck, sometimes by tapping into billions in aid =
money passing through each year.
>=20
> The new government says it now hopes to change that. After years of =
foot-dragging, the country signed a United Nations anti- corruption =
charter that will help its leaders recover illicit funds stashed abroad. =
It has reinvigorated an ineffective anti-graft commission, demanded =
financial statements from top politicians and is strengthening laws =
barring politicians convicted of corruption from office.
>=20
> "There's never been an example of this kind of turnaround. This is =
unprecedented," said Zaman, whose organization finds itself in the odd =
position of consulting closely with an unelected, military- supported =
government to promote democracy. "It's not the process we wanted. We =
wanted this done by political leadership. But since they miserably =
failed to deliver, it has come to this."
>=20
> Turning around Bangladesh's culture of political corruption will not =
be easy. Most of the investigators charged with tracking down the real =
estate records, bank statements and other documents needed to prosecute =
those now jailed have never done the work before and may be a little =
anxious about trying to put their former, and potentially future, bosses =
in prison.
>=20
> Those arrested have powerful friends and the money to hire the best =
lawyers in the country, and the country's prosecutors have never =
prosecuted corruption cases before. In some cases, caretaker officials =
may be faced with having to prosecute colleagues, friends and neighbors.
>=20
> In a country where court cases typically drag on for decades, the =
government has limited trials to 60 days, with adjournments -- a favored =
stalling tactic -- limited to three days. It has also hired private =
attorneys as prosecutors and dangled offers of incentive pay for =
investigators who find evidence that helps win convictions.
>=20
> But with limited resources "we're going mad trying to investigate all =
these high-profile cases at once," admitted Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury, =
chairman of the country's new independent Anti- Corruption Commission.
>=20
> The fear, said Ataur Rahman, a political corruption expert at the =
University of Dhaka, is that "if you can't get convictions, the message =
will be that nothing has changed."
>=20
> The anti-corruption commission and caretaker government also are =
trying to revamp key institutions, from removing executive influence in =
the judiciary to rebuilding the electoral commission, in an effort to =
stifle future pilferers.
>=20
> One of the keys, officials agree, is making sure Bangladesh's two =
political leading ladies exit politics for good. To that end, the =
government is willing to let them, and perhaps their families, avoid =
prosecution as long as they agree to leave Bangladesh permanently.
>=20
> Both face corruption charges, and Hasina faces murder charges as a =
result of deaths in street riots she is said to have helped provoke last =
October.
>=20
> "For the sake of stability, we are anxious they have an honorable =
exit," said Mainul Hossein, the caretaker government's key law and =
justice official, and one of 10 technocrats running the country. So far, =
the effort has enjoyed widespread support in a country where the =
military is seen as one of the most trustworthy institutions and =
corruption has been largely the domain of the rich and powerful, rather =
than reaching throughout society.
>=20
> "This government needs to stay as long as it can manage the country =
corruption-free," added Shadak Hossain, 30, an appliance store owner. =
"No other government can succeed against corruption."
>=20
> Military's lead worries some
>=20
> Since the corruption crackdown, sales of his expensive refrigerators, =
air conditioners and other appliances had plunged 40 percent, he said, =
largely because "people are afraid of being noticed and investigated for =
spending lots of money." But his cost of buying goods had also dropped =
20 percent, he said, now that the corrupt cartel that used to control =
wholesale distribution has gone into hiding.
>=20
> Bangladeshis remember well how neighboring Pakistan's military- led =
anti-corruption drive ended with the military entrenched in power. =
Already a few are calling for new elections before the government-set =
deadline of the end of 2008, and many in civil society worry that "it's =
easy to bring [the military] into politics and hard to push them back," =
Zaman said.
>=20
> Mainul Hossain, the law and justice official, insisted that the =
government knows its time is limited and that it is focused on creating =
conditions for new elections. Small-scale political gatherings, now =
banned under the state of emergency, will be legalized again within a =
month or so, he said. The government hopes new, better political leaders =
will rise from the ranks of the old parties, or that new ones will form, =
and that by the time elections are next called, anti-corruption reforms =
will have taken root.
>=20
> The real test for Bangladesh's democracy may well come if they have =
not.
>=20
> "Any transition is fraught with risks. There are many ifs, ands and =
buts before the end of the story," Zaman said. "But with the changes we =
have seen in the last three months, there are reasons to be optimistic."

> This was not supposed to be such a good moment for the stock market.
>=20
> Corporate earnings still are expected to look weaker this year, and =
fears of a meltdown in the subprime lending market have loomed. The =
dollar has been eroding against major currencies, and the overall =
outlook for the U.S. economy has been hazy.
>=20
> But as spring has sprung, everything on Wall Street has unexpectedly =
come up roses.
>=20
> The Dow Jones industrial average broke a record for the third day in a =
row Friday, with the benchmark index hurtling ahead 153.35 points, or =
1.2 percent, to 12,961.98.
>=20
> It was the seventh winning day in a row and a nearly 350-point gain =
for the week, putting the index within striking distance of the =
psychologically significant 13,000-point barrier earlier in the year =
than even optimists had anticipated.
>=20
> Of course, markets can reverse course quickly, and analysts already =
were looking ahead to the possibility of a correction next week, but =
what was striking on Friday was how strong the fundamentals look, =
particularly for American corporations.
>=20
> "We have had very good readings on both employment and spending in the =
U.S.," said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at LaSalle Bank. "Foreign =
economies are outperforming expectations and improving sales of U.S. =
products overseas. Those trends are flowing to corporate bottom lines. =
Our forecast is this is going to be a very good year."
>=20
> Among the blue-chips reporting first-quarter earnings this week, 10 of =
16 Dow components posted financial results that surpassed analyst =
forecasts, The Associated Press said.
>=20
> Those better-than-expected operating results, plus a general decline =
in shares outstanding, spurred analysts to boost estimates for =
first-quarter earnings-per-share growth at S&P 500 companies to 6.2 =
percent from last week's 3.1 percent, according to Bloomberg data.
>=20
> One of those surprise companies pushing the Dow higher Friday was =
Caterpillar Inc., the Peoria-based equipment giant, which closed up =
$3.20, at $71.82. The company said "exceptional growth" in foreign =
markets helped offset weak results in key U.S. sectors.
>=20
> "Earnings have come through as expected or better than expected," =
Peter Brodie, director of investments at Bryn Mawr Trust Co., said about =
the stock market in general.
>=20
> At the close of trading Friday, virtually every sector of the American =
stock market was up. The S&P 500 was up 13.62, to close at 1484.35, up =
4.66 percent for the year, and Nasdaq rose 21.04, to close at 2526.39, =
up 4.6 percent for the year.
>=20
> Of the 47 market subsectors followed by Bloomberg, ranging from oil =
service companies to middle-size companies to the entire New York Stock =
Exchange, not one ended lower Friday.
>=20
> "It's not a matter of 13,000 for the Dow; we could be looking at =
14,000 by the end of the year," Robert Froehlich, chief investment =
strategist for investment firm DWS Scudder, told the AP. "There's too =
much money out there chasing too few companies. This story isn't ending =

observers.

Brodie, though adding that the wise investor will ignore such ups and =
downs and allocate assets according to a plan.

subprime mortgages would infect financial markets. Subprime mortgages =
are loans made to home buyers with questionable credit and ability to =
repay the money.

credit," said Michael Church, portfolio manager of Church Capital =
Management. "That hasn't happened yet."

holdings of subprime mortgages, but won't much hurt big, diversified =
financial houses.

> Stanley Nabi, who helps oversee about $8 billion at Silvercrest Asset =
Management in New York, told Bloomberg that "pessimism over the outlook =

> Full text:
> Dear Abby: Twenty years ago, my sister and I bought a business from =
our mother. We all love and respect one another and get along well. We =
will be finished paying off the business in two years.
>=20
> Our problem: Mom, who is now 77, still draws a salary from us above =
and beyond the payment for the business. Her workload has lessened =
greatly, as it should. She could do all of her work in one day and =
lessen the burden of her salary. However, she says she'd "go crazy" if =
she retired. We don't want that. She could still come in as often as she =
wants and do her personal paperwork, banking, letter- writing, reading, =
etc. These are all things she does at "work" -- on the clock.
>=20
> If we try to discuss this, Mom gets hurt and says, "Just let me know =
when I'm not worth the money." We don't want to do that. We would hope =
she would see the fairness of this and suggest it herself.
>=20
> Business expenses are going through the roof, and there are updates we =
should make, but we can't do it as long as we are paying Mom at the =
level we are, on top of the money for the buyout.
>=20
> -- Daughters Dearest
>=20
> Dear Daughters: You do, indeed, have a problem. It's one that should =
be handled with the utmost diplomacy.
>=20
> Because your mother is an intelligent businesswoman, she must be a =
part of this decision. Schedule a business meeting between the three of =
you and put the budget on the table for discussion -- along with the =
updates that need to be made. Ideally, she will recognize the dilemma =
and suggest the cutback herself.
>=20
> If your mother fails to reduce her salary for the good of the company, =
begin "planting seeds" about how nice it would be to have time to devote =
to charity and how much she has to offer volunteerism. (It's the truth.) =
Research volunteer opportunities in your area, and perhaps even talk to =
some volunteer organizations about recruiting your mother. When she =
realizes how interesting and fulfilling these activities can be, =
encourage her to reduce her hours at work to enable her to contribute to =
the community. Good luck.
>=20
> Dear Abby: My mother-in-law is coming soon for her annual two- week =
visit, and my nightmares about it have already begun. She is 78 years =
young, sweet and non-judgmental. The problem is, she talks non- stop =
about people we have never met.
>=20
> When we introduce her to friends, she continues story after story =
about people who are of interest only to her.
>=20
> My mother-in-law lives alone. So do a lot of people, including my own =
mother, but no one talks as incessantly as she does. Why does she do =
this, and what can I do? Help!
>=20
> -- Talked To Death in Eugene, Ore.
>=20
> Dear Talked To Death: Compulsive talking can be a nervous habit, a =
sign of insecurity or an attempt to control. In your mother-in- law's =
case, it could also be because for two weeks a year, she has someone to =
talk to.
>=20
> Because her visits are so stressful, ask your doctor for advice on how =
to alleviate the stress.

> Full text:
> Despite assurances by U.S. and Macau officials, North Korea said =
Friday that it is still negotiating over possession of $25 million in =
North Korean accounts frozen by Macau banking authorities for the past =
21 months.
>=20
> The complicated financial dispute, although U.S. officials have =
repeatedly declared it resolved, has persisted in preventing =
implementation of an agreement Feb. 13 under which North Korea pledged =
to close its main nuclear reactor and allow verification by inspectors =
from the International Atomic Energy Agency.
>=20
> That accord was hailed as a breakthrough in nearly four years of =
on-again, off-again multinational talks aimed at dismantling North =
Korea's nuclear weapons program. Under its terms, the U.S. Treasury was =
to have the blocked funds freed within 30 days and North Korea was to =
stop operations at the Yongbyon reactor within 60 days. But both =
deadlines were missed, leaving the six-nation talks stalled yet again.
>=20
> After prolonged negotiations among U.S., Chinese, Macau and North =
Korean banking officials, the U.S. Treasury announced April 10 that =
Macau's Monetary Authority was ready to release the disputed money. On =
the strength of that announcement, the chief U.S. negotiator, Assistant =
Secretary of State Christopher Hill, said North Korea had no further =
reason not to honor its pledge to shut down the reactor.
>=20
> But the official Korean Central News Agency on Friday released a =
letter from Ri Je Son, head of the North Korean Department of Atomic =
Energy, saying "brisk" negotiations are still under way on what to do =
about the money.
>=20
> Through a spokeswoman, Wendy Au, the Monetary Authority of Macau =
refused to explain why North Korea would say talks are still going on 10 =
days after the U.S. Treasury and the monetary authority announced the =
money was ready for transfer.
>=20
> In his letter, Ri did not describe what the negotiations are about. =
Colin McAskill, a British banker, has claimed $7 million of the total =
represents legitimate earnings from trade with North Korea and should =
remain in accounts held by his Daedong Credit Bank. Japanese press =
reports have said a portion of the money has been transferred to North =
Korea while some of it remains in dispute.
>=20
> North Korea "remains unchanged in its will to implement the Feb. 13 =
agreement," Ri said in the letter. "But what matters is that it cannot =
move as the issue of frozen funds has not yet been completely settled."
>=20
> Ri's letter, addressed to Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the IAEA, was =
seen as an expression of continued goodwill despite the missed =
deadlines. In it, Ri repeated assurances that North Korea will invite =
IAEA inspectors into North Korea to supervise the Yongbyon reactor's =
closing "the moment the actual unfreezing of the frozen fund in the bank =
has been confirmed."
>=20
> The Macau Monetary Authority blocked the money after the U.S. Treasury =
alleged in September 2005 that a number of accounts in the Macau-based =
Banco Delta Asia were being used to launder illicit North Korean =
earnings. In response, North Korea boycotted the six- nation nuclear =
negotiations for more than a year.
>=20
> With Hill's pledge that the issue would be resolved, North Korea =
returned to the talks.

year. Unfazed, he responded: "Then it's time for the girls."
>=20
> He left with a similar donation.
>=20
> Born in 1917 on Chicago's South Side, Mr. MacLeod spent his youth in =
Southern California, where he attended Pomona College, a school to which =
he remained devoted.
>=20
> During his time on the Claremont campus, Mr. MacLeod was engaged in a =
number of activities, Pomona spokesman Don Pattison said. Those =
endeavors included serving as president of his fraternity and the =
inter-fraternity council, lettering on the school's swim team and taking =
photos for the yearbook.
>=20
> In 1939, Mr. MacLeod graduated from Pomona with a degree in economics =
and joined the school's board of trustees in 1963. After college, Mr. =
MacLeod served in the U.S. Navy Supply Corps during World War II, =
eventually earning the rank of lieutenant commander, his family said.
>=20
> After the war, he returned to the Chicago area and took a job with =
Harris Bank, eventually becoming a vice president.
>=20
> In the early 1970s, Mr. MacLeod moved from Winnetka to Highland Park, =
where he was a city councilman from 1983 to 1991. He helped establish =
the Highland Park Community Foundation, which financially supports local =
organizations.
>=20
> In 2006, Mr. MacLeod received the foundation's first Distinguished =
Citizen Award, his family said.
>=20
> Also known for his interest in gardening and skiing -- a sport he =
didn't give up until he turned 80 -- Mr. MacLeod loved nothing more than =
his family and wife of 37 years, Martha.
>=20
> "He was a very big family man and had quite a large family, with sons =
and daughters and stepsons and stepdaughters," Craig MacLeod said. "He =
also was absolutely devoted to his wife. You couldn't separate them, and =
she was his biggest concern when he was stuck in the hospital.
>=20
> "I don't know a lot of couples who were as tight as they were."
>=20
> In addition to his wife and son, Mr. MacLeod is survived by another =
son, Andrew; two daughters, Jessi Ruth MacLeod and Martha Flanders; a =
stepson, Price Patton; two stepdaughters, Ann Patton and Sarah Duncan; =
18 grandchildren and a great-grandchild.
>=20
> Services will be held at 3 p.m. Saturday at Trinity Episcopal Church, =
425 Laurel Ave, Highland Park.

> Full text:
> The U.S. House of Representatives on Friday approved a measure to give =
shareholders more say on how companies pay top executives, rejecting =
amendments by Republicans who said corporate boards already have enough =
power to set compensation.
>=20
> The measure, approved 269-134, aims to rein in pay levels that House =
Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank and other top =
Democrats called excessive by giving public-company shareholders annual =
non-binding votes on executive salaries.
>=20
> "There are, unfortunately, a lot of examples of excessive compensation =
for CEOs," Frank said after the vote. "It bites into other things that =
you would use the money for."
>=20
> Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, has made tackling exorbitant =
executive compensation a top priority since taking over as chairman in =
January. He criticized the severance package awarded to former Home =
Depot Inc. Chief Executive Robert Nardelli in January as a "$210 million =
goodbye kiss."
>=20
> There isn't a uniform, legal right for shareholders to vote on pay =
packages, Frank said. The legislation "will strengthen the hands of =
those in the corporate world who have been trying to slow this down," he =
said.
>=20
> The measure next goes to the Senate, where Sen. Barack Obama, an =
Illinois Democrat running for president, introduced legislation =
identical to Frank's bill on Friday.
>=20
> Frank said he hasn't discussed the measure with his counterpart, =
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.). The panel =
hasn't held hearings.
>=20
> Investor advocates have pressed companies to allow shareholders to =
vote on pay, which they say has gotten out of hand. Median pay for CEOs =
of U.S. companies rose 9.3 percent, to $2 million, in 2006, according to =
the Corporate Library, a corporate-governance research firm-based in =
Portland, Maine.
>=20
> Republicans said the proposal would steer talented executives to =
private companies, drive companies to list on overseas exchanges and =
empower "activist" investors who have their own agendas unrelated to the =
best interests of the company. Shareholders already have the right to =
propose a vote on executive pay, they said.
>=20
> The House rejected seven Republican amendments. One, by Rep. Tom Price =
of Georgia, would have allowed public companies to forgo the vote if the =
Securities and Exchange Commission concluded that it hindered their =
ability to compete for the best executives.
>=20
> "I'm all in favor of a shareholder vote, if it's done without a =
mandate from Washington," Price said.
>=20
> Another Republican amendment, introduced by Rep. Scott Garrett of New =
Jersey, would have allowed shareholder votes only if executive pay at =
the company was 10 percent or more than the average pay at companies in =
the same industry.
>=20
> If the bill becomes law, it's not clear it will have an impact. At =
annual meetings so far this year, shareholders have rejected non- =
binding votes on executive compensation at Morgan Stanley, Citigroup =
Inc., United Technologies Corp., U.S. Bancorp, Wachovia Corp. and =
Coca-Cola Co.

> 300
>=20
> 1/2: A fairly entertaining bloodbath designed to put audiences =
ringside in the 5th Century B.C. as the Spartans square off against the =
Persians. It's the few against the many, and the few are mighty fit. R. =
1:57. -- M.P.
>=20
> Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters
>=20
> 1/2: The cult cartoon goes big screen with the absurd adventures of =
fast-food pals -- a box of fries, a milkshake and a wad of meat. =
Hilarious for 20 minutes, but soon, even fans realize that junk food =
makes a great snack, but an awful diet. R. 1:27. -- Eric Gwinn
>=20
> Are We Done Yet?
>=20
> 1/2: Ice Cube and Nia Long got together in 2005's "Are We There Yet?" =
-- now twins are on the way. Time to buy a fixer-upper, blueprints =
provided by 1948's "Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House." PG. 1:32. -- =
M.P.
>=20
> Black Book
>=20
> 1/2: Paul Verhoeven's epic of the World War II Dutch resistance and an =
improbable affair between a Jewish spy (Carice van Houten) and a Gestapo =
chief (Sebastian Koch) -- is fast and entertaining. In several =
languages, with English subtitles. R. 2:25. -- M.W.
>=20
> Blades of Glory
>=20
> : Will Ferrell plays a maverick ice supergod; Jon "Napoleon Dynamite" =
Heder plays his more balletic and willowy rival, who becomes his guy/guy =
skating partner, initially against both boy- men's wishes. PG-13. 1:33. =
-- M.P.
>=20
> Disturbia
>=20
> : In this teen-slanted rehash of plot from Alfred Hitchcock's "Rear =
Window," Shia LaBeouf plays a suburban kid under house arrest who =
suspects his next-door neighbor (David Morse) is a serial killer. PG-13. =
1:44. -- M.W.
>=20
> Firehouse Dog
>=20
> : Presumed dead, a Hollywood canine is mistaken for a stray and =
adopted by a sullen 12-year-old (Josh Hutcherson), with an arson- =
investigating father (Bruce Greenwood). While the ad campaign suggests =
wacky antics, a surprisingly well-acted father/son relationship =
develops. PG. 1:51. -- M.P.
>=20
> First Snow
>=20
> : A smart, tense modern film noir about a cocky young hustler (Guy =
Pearce) suddenly face to face with his failings and the mortality that a =
fortune teller says will come in the first snows of winter. The movie =
has a marvelously crisp and uneasy mood. R. 1:41. - - M.W.
>=20
> Grindhouse ('Planet Terror'
>=20
> and 'Death Proof'
>=20
> 1/2): Faux '70s schlock with real energy in this expansively scuzzy =
three-hour double bill. Robert Rodriguez's "Planet Terror" presents a =
flesh-eating zombie attack; in Quentin Tarantino's "Death Proof," Kurt =
Russell plays a psychopath who earns his back-roads comeuppance. R. =
3:11. -- M.P.
>=20
> The Hoax
>=20
> : How did con artist/writer Clifford Irving (Richard Gere), who never =
met Howard Hughes, think he could get away with pretending he was the =
go-between for the billionaire's "memoirs," a manuscript Irving had =
written himself? The 1971 scam is re-created in director Lasse =
Hallstrom's fairly engrossing dramatic movie. R. 1:56. -- M.W.
>=20
> The Host
>=20
> 1/2: Chemical-dumping leads to serious mutant trouble. The first =
attack of the giant squid-lizard is a pip, masterly in its mix of =
deadpan wit and slimy thrills. Writer-director Bong Joon-ho keeps his =
focus on a family's response to the monster. R. 1:59. -- M.P.
>=20
> I Think I Love My Wife
>=20
> 1/2: Chris Rock's agreeably crass remake of the 1972 Rohmer film =
"Chloe in the Afternoon." Rock grapples with the temptation offered by =
an old and wildly available friend (Kerry Washington). R. 1:34. - - M.P.
>=20
> Journey =46rom the Fall
>=20
> : After the U.S. abandons South Vietnam, a family pays for it. The =
freedom-loving man (Long Nguyen) is brutally "re-educated"; his wife =
(Diem Lien), mother (Kieu Chinh) and son (Nguyen Thai Nguyen) suffer =
during and after their escape to America. Yet hope sustains them. In =
Vietnamese, with English subtitles. R. 2:15. -- Michael Esposito
>=20
> The Last Mimzy
>=20
> : A disappointing and badly retitled (from "Mimsy Were the =
Borogroves") film about contemporary children who find futuristic toys =
and are profoundly altered by them. The movie means well, but it botches =
a grand opportunity to update "Mimsy." PG. 1:38. -- M.W.
>=20
> Lions 3D
>=20
> : Very basic IMAX fare follows a lion "king" and his lionesses trying =
to survive in the Kalahari. Many beautiful images and physically =
rattling sound -- including elephants' low-frequency rumble of dislike =
for lions -- probably are worth the price of admission for some. No MPAA =
rating. 0:40. -- Michael Esposito
>=20
> The Lookout
>=20
> : A brain-damaged night janitor in a small-town bank (Joseph =
Gordon-Levitt) is drawn into a robbery scheme by old high school =
associates. The grade-A cast (Jeff Daniels, Isla Fisher and Matthew =
Goode) makes the most of writer-director Scott Frank's narrative. R. =
1:42. -- M.P.
>=20
> Meet the Robinsons
>=20
> : A frenetic, dizzying experience that's also a real technical =
breakthrough, a 3D cartoon feature of unusual depth and plasticity, =
about inventor kid Lewis, who travels to the future and has a battle =
royal with the evil Bowler Hat Guy. G. 1:32. -- M.W.
>=20
> The Namesake
>=20
> : A profound and beautiful film about an Indian family, the Gangulis, =
who move from Calcutta to New York and experience East- West cultural =
clash through several decades. In English and Bengali, with English =
subtitles. PG-13. 2:02. -- M.W.
>=20
> Pathfinder
>=20
> : A bloody adventure movie that hurls us into a 9th Century clash =
between Vikings and Native Americans led by a Viking-raised-by- Indians =
named Ghost (Karl Urban). R. 1:28. -- M.W.
>=20
> Perfect Stranger
>=20
> : Halle Berry plays a reporter investigating a hotshot ad honcho =
(Bruce Willis) who may have killed her friend. For an hour or so this =
awkwardly plotted mystery is entertaining, then it pratfalls into =
revelations that would make a cat laugh. R. 1:49. -- M.P.
>=20
> Premonition
>=20
> : Sandra Bullock plays a woman who doesn't know if her "dream," in =
which her husband dies in a horrible car accident, is a "dream" or =
"reality." It's like a depressive remake of "Groundhog Day." PG- 13. =
1:50. -- M.P.
>=20
> Pride
>=20
> : Terrence Howard rescues "Pride" from a sea of sports-film cliches as =
Jim Ellis, founder of the Philadelphia Department of Recreation swim =
team. Ellis takes a job at a pool scheduled for demolition, builds his =
team and guides it to the nationals. PG. 1:44. -- M.P.
>=20
> The Reaping
>=20
> 1/2: This overstuffed 10-pack plague thriller stars Hilary Swank as an =
LSU professor who has become "the foremost debunker of supposed =
miracles." Strange doings in bayou country debunk the debunker, leading =
to the usual CGI-larded Satan-vs.-God business. R. 1:36. -- M.P.
>=20
> Reign Over Me
>=20
> : Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle are ex-college buddies. Sandler's =
Charlie lost it after a 9/11 family tragedy, Cheadle's Alan is a =
successful dentist hitting some mid-life snags. It's an actor's show =
with a terrific cast. R. 2:08. -- M.W.
>=20
> Shooter
>=20
> : Feeding on cynicism about evil done in the name of freedom and oil =
prices, "Shooter" puts Mark Wahlberg, as a retired Marine sniper framed =
in an attempt on the president, on the run -- then on the hunt, aided by =
a disgruntled FBI agent (Michael Pena). R. 2:04. -- M.P.
>=20
> TMNT

> Full text:
> The Chicago Spire took another step toward becoming a 2,000-foot- high =
reality Thursday when the Chicago Plan Commission recommended that its =
current design by famed architect Santiago Calatrava be approved by the =
city zoning committee.
>=20
> During the hearing, Garrett Kelleher, chief executive of Shelbourne =
Development Ltd. of Dublin, said the tower would be "a unique building =
in a happening city."
>=20
> Regarding questions about finances, Kelleher told the commission that =
a top executive at the Anglo Irish Bank, headquartered in Dublin, "fully =
supports me, and I have shown their letter to the City of Chicago."
>=20
> But one high-rise developer wonders if that would be sufficient.
>=20
> "The world's tallest buildings are so expensive that they need =
countries or major corporations to bankroll them," said Steven Fifield, =
chairman of the Fifield Cos., which has built office and residential =
towers in Chicago and elsewhere in the U.S. "The Anglo Irish Bank is not =
big enough to be the sole lending source on a project that could =
approach $1,000 a square foot to develop.
>=20
> "That just isn't credible," Fifield said.
>=20
> Moving through the city approval process, Kelleher's firmwants to =
increase the amount of space to be built on its 2.2-acre lakefront site =
to 25 times the lot size, rather than 10 times the lot size. That would =
enable Shelbourne Development to build a 2.4-million- square-foot tower. =
It also seeks permission to build exit and entry ramps linked to Lake =
Shore Drive.
>=20
> Now that he has the Plan Commission's approval , Kelleher will ask the =
City Council's Zoning Committee for its OK of the twisting 150-story =
tower's design and site plan Thursday. If he clears that hurdle, he'll =
bring his project to the full City Council on May 9 for the final =
go-ahead.
>=20
> Prospects appear good.
>=20
> "This is a wonderful project, and everyone is very enthused," said =
Constance Buscemi, spokeswoman for the city's Planning Department.
>=20
> Shelbourne also has offered to pay $9 million toward the development =
of the nearby 3.2-acre DuSable Park. In exchange, Kelleher acquires a =
valuable marketing tool: He will offer prospective buyers a home with an =
expanse of much-treasured waterfront green space.
>=20
> Streeterville residents support the project on the north bank of the =
Chicago River at Lake Shore Drive, but they "continue to be concerned =
about traffic, completion of a [lakeside] bike path and the [DuSable] =
park," said Gail Spreen, president of the Streeterville Organization of =
Active Residents . She asked that neighbors be kept informed of project =
plans.
>=20

> If you would have told me a week ago that I'd be impressed with a Phil =
Stacey performance, I would have laughed in your face.
>=20
> But there you are -- Stacey was by far one of the best performers in =
Tuesday's "American Idol," which featured country music as the theme. =
It's not really my favorite genre, so I expected to be bored, but there =
were a couple of really good performances. Too bad they were =
front-loaded at the beginning of the night.
>=20
> But overshadowing the good performances of Stacey and Jordin Sparks =
was, of course, the Sanjaya Factor. Could it be any more clear that the =
"Idol" producers are once again trying to stir the Sanjaya Malakar pot? =
That allegedly antagonistic banter between Ryan Seacrest and Simon =
Cowell after the puffy-haired contestant performed was utterly fake and =
scripted, at least that's how it looked from where I was sitting, dawg.
>=20
> Ryan's faux outrage over Simon's harsh words was as artificially =
inflated as Sanjaya's hair. Please. It's all just part of "Idol's" =
campaign to turn the show into "As the Sanjaya Turns," a weekly soap =
about hairstyles and hype. Perhaps they feel the need to pump that =
aspect of the show in order to halt the ratings slide that shows no sign =
of slowing down.
>=20
> The truth of the matter is, while "Idol" is clearly still the Death =
Star of television, ratings are trending downward for the show this =
season. In some cases, ratings are down more than 10 percent over the =
same period a year or two years ago.
>=20
> Sure, any other television executive would kill for a show that rakes =
in about 28 million viewers for a typical episode, but "Idol's" ratings =
have been down across the board in the last month or two, and the early =
onset of daylight-saving time no longer cuts it as an excuse. No doubt =
other networks are salivating at the idea that "Idol" could be slipping. =
But who knows how long this ratings dip will last?
>=20
> At this point, you have to wonder if it would be better or worse if =
Sanjaya were ejected. On the one hand, he clearly doesn't deserve to be =
there vocally and is costing the show whatever scraps of credibility it =
has left.
>=20
> Maybe people are really tuning out because of Sanjaya -- but other =
explanations are equally valid. Perhaps America's love affair with the =
show is waning. Or maybe this year we just have a pretty boring bunch of =
contestants overall, as even Simon admitted in a recent interview.
>=20
> On the other hand, the man gives us something to talk about. And =
that's really the name of the game.
>=20
> As for Sanjaya's singing, here's a radical thought -- Sanjaya does =
have a nice vocal tone, when he projects his voice and sings in the =
right key and doesn't flatten out the notes. The problem is, he only =
does that about 30 percent of the time. The rest of the time, he's off =
the beat, off key, singing flatly and just hurting my eardrums. All =
things considered, he doesn't deserve to be on the show.
>=20
> But I have to give him props for working the controversy over his =
"Idol" stint like a pro. Yet another crazy hairdo emerged Tuesday, and =
he worked the stage and the crowd like an old hand. Say what you want to =
about Sanjaya, but there are major hair-care endorsements in his future. =
So shed no tears for his bank account.
>=20
> But let's face it, people, even Paula Abdul couldn't find it in her =
heart to say lots of gushy things about many of Tuesday's performances.
>=20
> Could Sanjaya, and the mostly bland final contestants, represent the =
beginning of the end for this ratings behemoth?

Country Club Hills, suffered a gunshot wound in the head as the result =
of a domestic situation, police said. But Richton Park police, who did =
not name the injured woman, said they are still investigating the =
shooting to find out what exactly happened.
>=20
> The man and woman were married, Richton Park Police Chief Vito Mannino =
said. But police don't know if they were living together in the housing =
complex or what led to the shooting.
>=20
> "We still have detectives working on it, and I don't have all the =
facts," Mannino said. "The initial indication is one shot the other and =
then shot themselves."
>=20
> According to a news release, police learned of the shooting at about =
7:45 a.m. when residents in the Lioncrest Townhouse complex called, =
saying they heard gunshots. When officers arrived at the complex near =
219th Street and Governors Highway, they found Banks lying on the ground =
in a parking lot, police said. His wife was about 20 yards away. A =
32-caliber semiautomatic handgun and numerous shell casings were =
recovered from the scene, police added.
>=20
> Both victims were transported to St. James Hospital Olympia Fields =
where Banks was pronounced dead at about 10 a.m. Mannino did not know =
the woman's condition.
>=20
> The shooting shook up the quiet community of privately owned town =
homes, where violent crime is uncommon. According to neighbors, at least =
one of the victims lived in the 3000 block of Richton Place, but none =
knew either of the victims.
>=20
> Diane Harris, 67, said she heard a woman screaming and then heard the =
shots. When she looked out her window, she was shocked to see a man's =
body in the parking lot.
>=20
> "I started praying right away," she said. "I didn't know what had been =
done or what happened. We're not used to this kind of stuff. It's a very =
quiet neighborhood."
>=20
> Harris' neighbor Tim Barnes Jr. said the shooting gave pause to all =
the residents.

debut film of the sadly neglected Erice is a work of sheer, entrancing =
beauty. Set in 1940, shortly after the Spanish Civil War. It centers =
around a little girl (the phenomenal Ana Torrent), who lives with her =
sister (Teresa Gimpera) and their once upper-middle- class parents =
(Fernando Fernan Gomez and Teresa Gimpera), in a large farmhouse -- and =
who becomes obsessed with the Spanish-dubbed version of [James Whale]'s =
1931 "Frankenstein," and [Boris Karloff] as the monster. In Spanish, =
with English subtitles. 9 p.m. [Thu].

> Full text:
> A movie about childhood and justice set in Southern small-town =
Depression-era America (Macomb County, Ala.), that feels like a classic =
from its very first moments, when it opens with a lyrical =
black-and-white credits sequence with spare piano music and a keepsake =
box. Based on Harper Lee's much-loved novel, "To Kill a Mockingbird" is =
a portrait of her own youth and relationship with her father, =
fictionalized in the film as upright, brave lawyer Atticus Finch =
(Gregory Peck). Lee's surrogate character, tomboy Scout (Mary Badham), =
roams the town with older brother Jem (Philip Alford) and their brainy, =
pint-size pal Dill (a character modeled on Lee's childhood friend Truman =
Capote and played by John Megna). As she explores, she learns; in some =
ways, Lee's novel is a female equivalent to Mark Twain's "Huckleberry =
Finn."
>=20
> Few films have caught the special feel and rhythms of childhood so =
well, with such uncondescending warmth and humor. And few bring out more =
powerfully the themes of anti-racism and the virtues and joys of =
community and family. The stirring courtroom scene, in which Finch =
defends an African-American man (Brock Peters as Tom Robinson) falsely =
accused of rape, keys the whole film. So do the climactic scenes with =
Robert Duvall (in his movie debut) as the mysterious recluse Boo Radley. =
This beautiful, crisply compassionate adaptation -- from director Robert =
Mulligan, producer Alan Pakula, screenwriter Horton Foote and composer =
Elmer Bernstein -- pierces and gladdens the heart. The credits don't =
lie: It's an American classic.

> *'Head On' *** 1/2 (Germany/Turkey; Fatih Akin, 2004). A brutally =
convincing movie about two hellbent young Turkish-German lovers on the =
edge of destruction in a Hamburg underworld of drugs and casual sex. Yet =
it's also compassionate. There's a strange lyricism and despair in =
writer-director Akin's taut, driving evocation of the love beneath the =
dangerous passions of his main characters: a drunken, brawling stage =
worker (Birol Unel) and his out-of-control mate (Sibel Kekilli). Winner =
of five major German Oscars, including best film, and the Golden Bear =
(grand prize) of the Berlin Film Festival. In German and Turkish, with =
English subtitles. 8 p.m. Fri.

outrageous Spike Lee movie is a shock-comedy about the evils of =
African-American media stereotypes. Starring Damon Wayans, Michael =
Rapaport, Savion Glover and Tommy Davidson, this film takes you from =
uproarious laughter to discomfort to stunned silence. 7:30 p.m. Fri., 6 =

Sun.

> *'Old Joy' *** (U.S.; Kelly Reichardt, 2006). A lovely film about two =
old friends who get together for an outing in Oregon's Cascade =
Mountains. One of them, Mark (Daniel London) is a husband with =
responsibilities. The other -- bearded Kurt (Will Oldham) -- is a =
bohemian type with no ties. Reichardt brings to "Old Joy" a sensibility =
both literary and cinematic and a deep, unsentimental compassion. 7, 9, =
11 p.m. Sat., 1 p.m. Sun.
>=20
> *'Salt of the Earth' *** (Herbert Biberman; 1953). Blacklisted =
director Biberman and blacklisted writers Michael Wilson and Paul =
Jarrico joined forces with the International Union of Mine, Mill and =
Smelter Workers to create one of the most fervently pro-labor movies of =
the '50s. A McCarthy-era leftist classic, it's a strike drama about =
Latino mine workers, set in New Mexico. With Rosaura Revueltas and Will =
Geer. 7 p.m. Mon.
>=20
> 'The Burmese Harp' **** (Japan; Kon Ichikawa. 1956). Ichikawa's great =
anti-war film, set in Burma at the end of World War II, about a deserter =
masquerading as a Buddhist monk (Shoji Yasui), who falls into grace. =
This is the Japanese classic with the great "Home, Sweet Home" scene. =
With Rentaro Mikuni; based on the story by Michio Takeyama. In Japanese, =
with English subtitles. 7:30 p.m. Tue.
>=20
> *'Frankenstein' **** (U.S.; James Whale, 1931). =46rom Mary Shelley's =
novel about "the modern Prometheus": a classic that still scares us and =
involves our emotions in curious ways. The horrific story and Whale's =
stylish direction create unusual sympathy for the movie's unique =
monster, Boris Karloff, as the hulking graveyard being brought to life =
("It's alive!") by Colin Clive's mad-eyed scientist Frankenstein. 7 p.m. =
Thu.
>=20
> *'The Spirit of the Beehive' **** (Spain; Victor Erice, 1973). The =
debut film of the sadly neglected Erice is a work of sheer, entrancing =
beauty. Set in 1940, shortly after the Spanish Civil War. It centers =
around a little girl (the phenomenal Ana Torrent), who lives with her =
sister (Teresa Gimpera) and their once upper-middle- class parents =
(Fernando Fernan Gomez and Teresa Gimpera), in a large farmhouse -- and =
who becomes obsessed with the Spanish-dubbed version of James Whale's =
1931 "Frankenstein," and Boris Karloff as the monster. In Spanish, with =
English subtitles. 9 p.m. Thu.

> 'Waking Ned Devine' *** 1/2 (U.K.; Kirk Jones, 1998). This madly =
hilarious little British comedy by first-time director Jones is all =
about a small village in rural Ireland consumed by greed and awash in =
deception, a charmingly archaic and isolated little coastal community =
that, in the space of a few weeks, seems merrily on the road to hell. =
The source of the fall: a winning lottery ticket. Along the way, as the =
film revives the old Ealing Studio spirit, "Ned" delivers dozens of the =
small, smart delights we used to expect from movie comedies. And, as =
long as Ian Bannen and David Kelly are on screen, it's funny enough to =
wake the dead. 8 p.m. Fri.

reckless driver Joe Greer, Eric Linden as the younger brother he loves, =
and Joan Blondell and Ann Dvorak as gals on the track. 8 p.m. Sat.

> Full text:
> Chicago's great gamble in the sky is about to begin in earnest, and =
the odds are now better than even money that it will succeed as a work =
of skyline sculpture and as a building that engages the city around it.
>=20
> After months of struggle, Zurich-based architect Santiago Calatrava =
finally has been able to make a winning match between visual poetry and =
the harsh realities of economics in his design for the twisting, =
2,000-foot Chicago Spire, which would be the nation's tallest building.
>=20
> Even if the design that the Chicago Plan Commission approved Thursday =
lacks some of the balletic elan of the original plan for this tower =
unveiled two years ago, it remains a powerful sculptural object with a =
strong structural rationale -- an innovative successor to such great =
Chicago skyscrapers as the twin corncobs of Bertrand Goldberg's Marina =
City.
>=20
> But the 150-story tower is nonetheless a gamble, and not just for the =
developer, Dublin-based Garrett Kelleher, who insists this is no =
pie-in-the-sky skyscraper even if he refuses to reveal its cost or the =
price tag of its condos.
>=20
> No one has ever built a twisting tower this tall, though a smaller =
version of this type is under construction in Dubai. For all the allure =
of Calatrava's architectural models, the Spire they show is as much an =
abstract sculpture as it is a real building. One wonders how the =
stunning geometry will look when everyday necessities -- windows, for =
instance -- intrude.
>=20
> At best, this will be a new Eiffel Tower, a scale-shattering yet =
superb skyline statement that becomes the new postcard image of Chicago.
>=20
> At worst, as less persuasive renderings of the tower suggest, it will =
be a visual cartoon, a supersize, superskinny version of a soft- serve =
ice cream cone.
>=20
> Inevitably, some will lament that this is not the original version of =
the tower, called the Fordham Spire, which proposed a hotel and =
communications antenna as well as condos on a vacant site west of Lake =
Shore Drive and on the north bank of the Chicago River. But that design =
was a seductive fantasy. This one, which would house about 1,200 =
condominiums, is striving to be real.
>=20
> Certainly, it has made great strides toward balancing form and =
finance, especially since December, when Calatrava made public a banal, =
nearly flat-topped version of the skyscraper. It instantly was tagged =
"Twizzler Tower" for resembling a piece of licorice.
>=20
> Since then, the restless architect has moved gradually to the present =
plan, in which the tower rises energetically but nobly, making a =
360-degree twist as it moves from the ground to a sharply articulated =
summit.
>=20
> In January, he unveiled sketches to the Tribune that gave the tower a =
newly pointed top and promised a restoration of the tower's whirling =
upward drive. Then, accommodating complex structural requirements, he =
settled on the current design, which is somewhat bulkier than the =
pencil-like January version but remains attractively slender. Gone is =
another version, also revealed to community groups last month, that had =
too much twist in its top and revealed Calatrava's tendency to lapse =
into the visually hyperactive.
>=20
> But the sky-high aesthetic risks haven't disappeared.
>=20
> Materials make a difference
>=20
> Calatrava needs to settle on materials -- he wants the exterior to =
include stainless steel, like the cladding of the much-admired Inland =
Steel Building of 1958 at 30 W. Monroe St. -- yet how they are detailed =
and manufactured is crucial.
>=20
> The gap between vision and reality is already apparent in the glass =
exterior of the under-construction, 1,362-foot Trump International Hotel =
& Tower by the Chicago office of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. Renderings =
by the architect showed an elegant glass skin, but parts of the exterior =
as built bring to mind distorted fun-house mirrors.
>=20
> However the skyline drama turns out, the Spire has a greatly improved, =
ground-level design that belies the rap that Calatrava's skyscrapers are =
like ice sculptures, chilling the cities around them.
>=20
> More-approachable approach
>=20
> With Kelleher's encouragement, the architect has moved far beyond the =
original Fordham Spire plan, in which a ziggurat-shaped parking podium =
surrounded the tower's base and pretty much held the city at bay.
>=20
> Instead, with Kelleher approving an expensive underground parking =
garage and asking the architect to plan the proposed 3.2-acre DuSable =
Park just to the east, Calatrava has given this enormous tower the =
fine-grained detail it needs to be a city-enlivening addition to both =
the riverfront and the lakefront.
>=20
> The appealing features include a grand, circular plaza set between the =
tower and the north bank of the Chicago River. In addition, Calatrava's =
plans call for pedestrian passageways that will lead beneath the =
superstructure of Lake Shore Drive to the proposed DuSable Park, where =
Calatrava would handsomely sculpt the landscape. Undoubtedly Kelleher =
will market the tower as sitting in a 5-acre park, not the 2-acre =
building site. But the plans also promise to make this skyscraper much =
more than just an object to be ogled from afar.
>=20
> True, traffic remains a concern, especially because tourists are sure =
to flock to this building. Signs will be needed to point those who come =
on wheels to nearby parking garages. Wisely, the tower's garage won't be =
open to the public, which should prevent a recurrence of the 1993 =
terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, when a bomb-laden van =
exploded in the center's underground parking garage, killing six people =
and injuring more than 1,000.
>=20
> For all the questions looming around the Spire, however, this much is =
clear: The planned skyscraper has the aesthetic and urban design stature =
to match its projected height. Now the great drama begins: Will this =
thing actually get built? Will the reality match the promise?
>=20
> Yes, Calatrava said Wednesday in an interview, explaining that the =
developer already is getting bids for caissons. His talents as a real =
estate oddsmaker, one hopes, are a match for his skills in shaping =
skyscrapers.

> Full text:
> Tribune Co. reported dismal first-quarter results Thursday, colored by =
a 12 percent slide in operating cash flow as the newspaper industry =
continued to suffer erosion in advertising revenue and circulation.
>=20
> The company's results lagged behind its peers, turning up the heat on =
the Chicago-based media conglomerate, which early this month announced =
plans to take itself private in partnership with billionaire Sam Zell.
>=20
> Faced with declining revenue and pressure to cut costs, the company is =
planning to offer employee buyouts to eliminate jobs, said sources =
familiar with the situation.
>=20
> These sources didn't know how many jobs are targeted companywide but =
said the Chicago Tribune Co. is expected to issue a request for buyouts =
on Monday, with a goal of eliminating 100 positions. If the offers don't =
generate enough savings, one source said, the company may resort to =
layoffs.
>=20
> A spokesman wouldn't comment on the cuts and didn't make executives =
available to discuss the quarterly results.
>=20
> Tribune, which also owns the Los Angeles Times, WGN-Ch. 9 and other =
media properties, has been cutting jobs at its various properties for =
several years. One source said the current effort is part of Tribune =
Co.'s previously announced push to shave $200 million in expenses over =
the next two years, a target that is built in to the assumptions of the =
bankers financing the Zell buyout plan.
>=20
> That deal has increased pressure on Tribune to improve results, or at =
least maintain last year's level of cash flow, amid a slump in =
advertising and circulation revenue as readers defect to the Internet.
>=20
> But Thursday's numbers showed that Tribune's financial results =
continued to erode in the first quarter, and analysts said there was no =
evidence the company has hit bottom.
>=20
> Tribune reported a net loss of $15.6 million in the first quarter, =
compared with a gain of $102.8 million a year earlier. But those results =
included a slew of one-time factors, and analysts paid more attention to =
the decline in operating cash flow to $238 million from $271 million. =
Cash flow is what companies use to pay down debt.
>=20
> Several other big newspaper publishers, including Gannett Co. and the =
New York Times Co., also reported declines in advertising and =
circulation revenues this week. But Tribune's results were "on the =
weaker side," said John Puchalla, an analyst at Moody's Investors =
Service.
>=20
> He pointed out that Tribune's newspaper revenue fell 5.5 percent =
versus an average decline of 2.3 percent for other companies reporting =
results.
>=20
> The most alarming aspect of the Tribune report was the drop in cash =
flow. Despite a 4 percent decline in overall revenue, to $1.2 billion, =
and a 2 percent drop in expenses, Tribune's operating cash flow fell =
much more precipitously.
>=20
> The reason is that Tribune is fast losing revenue in high-margin =
businesses such as real estate and help-wanted classified ads. The costs =
associated with classified ads are low, so as volume increases, profit =
climbs. But when volume declines, it comes straight out of earnings.
>=20
> Mike Simonton, an analyst for Fitch Ratings in Chicago, said that real =
estate classifieds in particular propped up Tribune earnings in 2005 and =
for much of 2006. But when the boom turned to bust, especially in =
Florida, "a disproportionate amount of profit came off the table," he =
said.
>=20
> Tribune has insulated itself to some degree by building online =
classified businesses like CareerBuilder.com and Apartments.com. But =
even though online revenue grew a promising 17 percent during the =
quarter, to $60 million, that is only 5 percent of the company's total.
>=20
> Zell, who is leading an effort to take Tribune private in a complex =
deal that will involve taking on $8.4 billion in new debt, wasn't fazed =
by the results. The first-quarter results were "well within our =
expectations," Zell said, pointing out that the falloff in real estate =
classifieds was exaggerated by bad comparisons.
>=20
> "Florida is going through one of its every-five-year periods of =
oversupply," he said. "The numbers a year ago were off the charts."
>=20
> Since he emerged as the winner in the Tribune bidding in early April, =
however, Zell has said he doesn't believe that cost-cutting will solve =
the company's problems. He and Tribune Chief Executive Dennis FitzSimons =
have said the company will be able to pay down its heavy debt load if it =
can simply maintain last year's cash-flow level of $1.4 billion. But to =
do that, they will have to find ways to wring better performance out of =
the company's old-media assets.
>=20
> One source close to the company said the covenants on the debt =
agreements financing the deal give Tribune some wiggle room this year. =
But the banks likely expect better results as the year moves forward.
>=20
> That helps explain why FitzSimons invited Harvard Business School =
professor John Kotter, a noted expert on leading change, to come address =
his top managers on Wednesday. Kotter talked about creating a sense of =
urgency and removing the barriers that get in the way of doing new =
things, sources said. They added that FitzSimons told the assembled =
executives that the company is adopting Kotter's eight- step program for =
guiding change, and that their only choice was to get on board.
>=20
> Some attendees said that it wasn't clear what their marching orders =
were, but one said, "It was a good start."
>=20
> "There was an urgency to move forward," he said. "We have to =
transform."

While this 1981 service comedy is pure formula, made at a time when the =
notion of Americans in combat seemed improbable in the extreme, Murray =
lightens the load with his deader-than-deadpan line readings. (Ever been =
convicted of a crime? "Convicted? No.") P.J. Soles and Sean Young play =
the MPs.

Dickens' classic of London street crime, stars John Howard Davies as =

"Odd Man Out" is the extraordinary 1947 thriller about a botched IRA =
bank robbery and the badly wounded and increasingly feverish rebel, =
Johnny (James Mason), who wanders Belfast with both his mates and the =
police on his trail. Newton pops up again as the mad painter Lukey.

> Full text:
> Republican presidential contender John McCain, known for having a =
quirky sense of humor, joked about bombing Iran at a campaign appearance =
this week.
>=20
> In response to an audience question about military action against =
Iran, the Arizona senator briefly sang the chorus of "Barbara Ann."
>=20
> "That old, eh, that old Beach Boys song, Bomb Iran," he said in jest =
Wednesday, chuckling with the crowd. Then, he softly sang to the melody: =
"Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, anyway, ah. ... " The audience responded with =
more laughter.
>=20
> His quip was prompted by a man in the audience who asked: "How many =
times do we have to prove that these people are blowing up people now, =
never mind if they get a nuclear weapon, when do we send 'em an airmail =
message to Tehran?"
>=20
> The campaign stop was in Murrells Inlet, S.C.
>=20
> After his joke, McCain turned serious and said that he agrees with =
President Bush that the United States must protect Israel from Iran and =
work to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. McCain has long =
said the military option should not be taken off the table but used only =
as a last resort.
>=20
> The episode echoed President Reagan's 1984 quip at the height of the =
nuclear arms race when he said: "My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to =
tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia =
forever. We begin bombing in five minutes."
>=20
> Reagan was testing a microphone before his regular Saturday radio =
address.
>=20
> In other developments involving candidates or possible candidates:
>=20
> *New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson will launch biographical ads in Iowa =
and New Hampshire on Monday.
>=20
> The ads signal Richardson's aggressive steps after raising $6.25 =
million in the first quarter that left him with $5 million in the bank.
>=20
> *New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg gathered the city's wealthiest =
and most active political donors Thursday -- and didn't ask for money.
>=20
> Instead, he reminded his guests at the posh Four Seasons restaurant =
that before they give, they should make sure the candidate is on New =
York's side on a checklist of issues, including funds for ailing Ground =
Zero workers.

> Full text:
> A U.S. military brigade is constructing a 3-mile-long concrete wall to =
cut off one of Baghdad's most restive Sunni Arab districts from the =
Shiite Muslim neighborhoods that surround it, raising concern about the =
further Balkanization of Iraq's capital.
>=20
> U.S. commanders in northern Baghdad say the 12-foot-high barrier will =
make it harder for suicide bombers, death squads and militia fighters =
from sectarian factions to attack one another and slip back to their =
home turf. Construction began last week and is expected to be completed =
by the end of the month.
>=20
> Although Baghdad is replete with blast walls, checkpoints and other =
temporary barriers, including a massive wall around the Green Zone, the =
wall being constructed in Adhamiya would be the first to essentially =
divide a neighborhood by sect.
>=20
> A largely Sunni district, Adhamiya is one of Baghdad's flash points, =
avoided not only by Shiites but also by Sunni outsiders. The area is =
almost completely surrounded by Shiite-dominated districts.
>=20
> The ambitious project is a sign of how far the U.S. military will go =
to end the non-stop bloodshed in Iraq. But U.S. officials said the =
barrier is not a central tactic of the security crackdown announced Feb. =
13.
>=20
> "We defer to commanders on the ground, but dividing up the entire city =
with barriers is not part of the plan," U.S. military spokesman Lt. Col. =
Christopher Garver said Thursday.
>=20
> News of the construction was first reported Thursday by the newspaper =
Stars and Stripes.
>=20
> Sunnis and Shiites living in the shadow of the barrier are united in =
their contempt for the imposing new structure.
>=20
> "Are they trying to divide us into different sectarian cantons?" said =
a Sunni drugstore owner in Adhamiya who identified himself as Abu Ahmed, =
44. "This will deepen the sectarian strife and only serve to abort =
efforts aimed at reconciliation."
>=20
> Some of Ahmed's customers come from Shiite or mixed neighborhoods that =
are now cut off by large barriers along a highway. Customers and others =
seeking to cross into the Sunni district must park their cars outside =
Adhamiya, walk through a narrow pedestrian passage in the walls and =
catch taxis on the other side.
>=20
> Several residents interviewed likened the project to the massive =
barriers built around some Palestinian zones in Israel.
>=20
> "Are we in the West Bank?" asked Abu Qusay, 48, a pharmacist who said =
that access to his favorite kebab restaurant in Adhamiya has been cut =
off.
>=20
> "I feel this is the beginning of a pattern of what the whole of Iraq =
is going to look like, divided by sectarian and racial criteria," said =
Abu Marwan, 50, a Shiite pharmacist.
>=20
> The construction in Adhamiya is not the first time U.S. military =
planners have attempted to isolate hostile regions. In 2005, U.S. troops =
tried to surround the Sunni-dominated city of Samarra with earthen berms =
to prevent insurgents from entering and leaving the city. A similar =

> Full text:
> Here are some tips for safer Internet surfing, according to Roland =
Dobbins, a network engineer who helps develop security solutions for =
Cisco Systems.
>=20
> * Do it yourself: Connect and disconnect from the Internet manually by =
right clicking on the wireless Internet icon and either enabling or =
disabling the connection. This prevents your computer from searching out =
Internet and possibly fake access points automatically without your =
knowledge.
>=20
> * Be unique: Change default names of your network from "Linksys" to a =
unique name (not your home address) and change any default passwords as =
soon as possible.
>=20
> * Don't share: Keeping your network open or allowing others access to =
shared files leaves a big hole in your system for hackers. Deactivate =
all sharing. If you must share because you are on a corporate network, =
make sure you change these settings when you are outside the office.
>=20
> * Be selective: In the computing world, promiscuity is a sure way of =
getting yourself a virus or attracting a hacker. Connect to =
"infrastructure" points, or official access points, rather than =
"peer-to-peer" connections, or another user's computer. Set your Network =
Connections to only connect to infrastructure points. The default =
searches for all open hot spots.
>=20
> Be wary: If you get an e-mail from your bank, make sure the e- mail is =
indeed from your bank and that you are being routed to the bank. Put =
your cursor over the link and look at the address, or right click on =
properties and see where it will lead you. Always go to the bank site =
via its main site in a new window, not via a link in an e-mail. Also, if =
your computer pops up with a security certificate warning, do not click =
away without inspecting the certificate and the signature. Even then, =
certificates are easily faked. If you must continue using the Internet, =
do not do anything sensitive. Best thing to do? Walk away.
>=20
> ... And if you fail?
>=20
> Computers get compromised all the time. Your reaction can save you a =
lot of agony. First, turn off your computer immediately, do not reboot, =
and disconnect it. Then call your help desk. Once you get your computer =
back up, change all passwords.

> Abstract:
>=20
> James Benson Scoville, a long-time resident of Barrington, IL, passed =
away on Saturday, April 14, 2007. Mr. Scoville was born on Dec. 12, 1924 =
in Riverside, IL. As a child, he spent his summers in Old Mission, MI =
and at camps in northern Minnesota, and New Hampshire where he developed =
his lifelong love for the outdoors. He considered this love to be his =
most important "hobby". He studied mechanical engineering and fine arts =
at the University of Michigan and was elected President of his Sigma Chi =
fraternity. Mr. Scoville then worked as a mechanical engineer for =
Electromotive, a division of General Motors. In 1946, Mr. Scoville =
continued the family tradition by joining the Chicago Board of Trade =
where he remained a member for over 60 years. As a third generation =
trader, he followed a line of Scoville members that began in 1883 with =
his Grandfather, Amasa Unrah Scoville that spanned over 120 years. He =
was honored by the Chicago Board of Trade in May, 2003, by having his =
"JBS" trading badge acronym retired and placed on the Chicago Board of =
Trade "Wall of Fame." When the commodity markets slowed for several =
years in the late 1950's, he formed Scoville & Associates, an =
advertising and design firm. His clients included several Fortune 500 =
companies, and he earned recognition with a national design award. He =
returned to full time trading in 1960, and began trading silver in 1969 =
when silver futures were introduced as the first non-grain futures =
product at the Chicago Board of Trade. With the introduction of this new =
market, he wrote an internationally known silver futures advisory =
letter, which was distributed daily by all of the major news wire =
services and followed throughout the world.

his lifelong love for the outdoors. He considered this love to be his =
most important "hobby". He studied mechanical engineering and fine arts =
at the University of Michigan and was elected President of his Sigma Chi =
fraternity. Mr. Scoville then worked as a mechanical engineer for =
Electromotive, a division of General Motors. In 1946, Mr. Scoville =
continued the family tradition by joining the Chicago Board of Trade =
where he remained a member for over 60 years. As a third generation =
trader, he followed a line of Scoville members that began in 1883 with =
his Grandfather, Amasa Unrah Scoville that spanned over 120 years. He =
was honored by the Chicago Board of Trade in May, 2003, by having his =
"JBS" trading badge acronym retired and placed on the Chicago Board of =
Trade "Wall of Fame." When the commodity markets slowed for several =
years in the late 1950's, he formed Scoville & Associates, an =
advertising and design firm. His clients included several Fortune 500 =
companies, and he earned recognition with a national design award. He =
returned to full time trading in 1960, and began trading silver in 1969 =
when silver futures were introduced as the first non-grain futures =
product at the Chicago Board of Trade. With the introduction of this new =
market, he wrote an internationally known silver futures advisory =
letter, which was distributed daily by all of the major news wire =
services and followed throughout the world. While still actively =
involved in the Board of Trade silver market, he joined the Chicago =
Mercantile Exchange in 1972 as a member of the International Monetary =
Market. Mr. Scoville was an enthusiastic racing sailor. A member of the =
Chicago Yacht Club and the Lake Michigan Yachting Association, he sailed =
out of Belmont harbor for many years with the 22 square meter fleet. His =
boat was named "Icicle". He won first place in the Universal Division of =
the Michigan City Race in 1956 and the Waukegan to Chicago Race in 1958. =
Mr. Scoville was also an avid skier, belonging to the Willow Springs Ski =
Club in the late 1940s, and later joined the Snow Chase Ski Club, the =
oldest downhill ski club in the country. In the early days of downhill =
skiing, he frequently traveled by train to Sun Valley and Aspen where he =
enjoyed skiing with many of the early ski pioneers. When not skiing in =
the West, he served as the head of the Ski School at Gander Mountain Ski =
Area. Mr. Scoville played golf as a junior member of the Riverside Golf =
Club with a one handicap. He later joined the Barrington Hills Country =
Club where he was a member for over 35 years. Mr. Scoville enjoyed =
hunting, fishing, skeet and trap shooting and was a member of the =
Barrington Sportsmen's Club. He and his wife Peggy were avid hunters =
traveling north to bow hunt, camping in their canvas replica of "Sitting =
Bull's" teepee; and venturing to Wyoming, Montana and Idaho in pursuit =
of black bear, deer, elk and antelope. Mr. Scoville was an expert duck =
caller. His passion for duck hunting along the Illinois flyway zone, =
near the Kankakee River, was born from early trips with his father and =
mother. A lifelong naturalist, he was a founding Director of Citizens =
for Conservation in Barrington. He also served on the Board of the North =
Barrington Association. He founded Scoville Fish Hatchery, raising =
mature northern pike for the purposes of stocking local lakes. He also =
raised pheasants, ducks, and wild turkeys. Mr. Scoville was a noted =
collector and historian of Plains Indian artifacts and Western artists =
and illustrators. His collection is known as "The Scoville Museum of the =
Indian Wars." He was also a fine artist and poet. His poem, "The Old Elk =
Speaks" was selected for CowboyPoetry.com. Mr. Scoville will be =
remembered by the many lives he touched and the difference he made their =
lives. His honesty, integrity and devotion to his family was admired by =
his family and friends. He was the husband of Margaret "Peggy" Louise, =
nee Woodward. They married in Bloomington, IN on April 30, 1955 and have =
enjoyed over 51 years of marriage; father of Laura Anne (Larry) Ekstrom =
of Barrington, Lucinda "Cindy" (Kevin) Seibert of Barrington, and James =
Woodward of Chicago; grandfather of Grant Woodward Ekstrom, Ella =
Albright Ekstrom, Sarah Benson Seibert and Megan Stark Seibert; brother =
of the late Walter (Lois) of California, Mary May (Irv) Busse of =
California, Delight Slavik Bowman of California, and Jeanette (the late =
Alex) Petrie of Deerfield, IL. Visitation will be held on Saturday, =
April 21, 2007 from 9:30 to 10:30 a.m. at the Barrington United =
Methodist Church (located at the corner of Route 59 and Algonquin Rd., =
entrance on Algonquin Road). A funeral service will follow the =
visitation at 10:30 a.m. Interment at Evergreen Cemetery in Barrington. =
In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to the Scoville =
Memorial Fund, in care of Barrington Bank and Trust, 201 South Hough =
St., Barrington, IL 60010. For information call 847-836-5540.

> Full text:
> The political hurdles facing the developer of a proposed tower in =
Chicago that would be North America's tallest structure don't seem =
nearly as daunting as the financial ones.
>=20
> The Chicago Spire took another step toward becoming a 2,000-foot- high =
reality Thursday when the Chicago Plan Commission recommended that its =
current design by famed architect Santiago Calatrava be approved by the =
city zoning committee.
>=20
> But given Garrett Kelleher's reticence to reveal project cost or unit =
prices and the fact that he has yet to start marketing or secure the =
necessary loans, questions abound about the financial feasibility of a =
project that could cost more than $2 billion.
>=20
> During the hearing, Kelleher, chief executive of Shelbourne =
Development Ltd. of Dublin, said the tower would be "a unique building =
in a happening city."
>=20
> Regarding questions about the project's finances, Kelleher told the =
commission that a top executive at the Anglo Irish Bank, headquartered =
in Dublin, "fully supports me and I have shown their letter to the City =
of Chicago."
>=20
> But one high-rise developer wonders if that would be sufficient.
>=20
> "The world's tallest buildings are so expensive that they need =
countries or major corporations to bankroll them," said Steven Fifield, =
chairman of the Fifield Cos., which has built office and residential =
towers in Chicago and elsewhere in the U.S. "The Anglo Irish Bank is not =
big enough to be the sole lending source on a project that could =
approach $1,000 a square foot to develop.
>=20
> "That just isn't credible."
>=20
> Moving through the city approval process, Kelleher's firm wants to =
increase the amount of space to be built on its 2.2-acre lakefront site =
to 25 times the lot size, rather than 10 times the lot size. That would =
enable Shelbourne Development to build a 2.4 million-square-foot tower. =
It also seeks permission to build exit and entry ramps linked to Lake =
Shore Drive.
>=20
> Now that he has the Plan Commission's approval, Kelleher will ask the =
City Council's Zoning Committee for its OK of the twisting 150- story =
tower's design and site plan Thursday. If he clears that hurdle, he'll =
bring his project to the full City Council on May 9 for the final =
go-ahead.
>=20
> Prospects appear good.
>=20
> "This is a wonderful project, and everyone is very enthused," said =
Constance Buscemi, spokeswoman for the city's Planning Department.
>=20
> Shelbourne also has offered to pay $9 million toward the development =
of the nearby 3.2-acre DuSable Park. In exchange, Kelleher acquires a =
valuable marketing tool: He will offer prospective buyers a home with an =
expanse of much-treasured waterfront green space.
>=20
> Streeterville residents support the project on the north bank of the =
Chicago River at Lake Shore Drive, but they "continue to be concerned =
about traffic, completion of a [lakeside] bike path and the [DuSable] =
park," said Gail Spreen, president of the Streeterville Organization of =
Active Residents. She asked that neighbors be kept informed of project =
plans.
>=20
> If, as expected, the spire gets a green light from the city, the 40 =
months of construction will get under way this spring, said Thomas =
Murphy, general counsel to Shelbourne. But, he added, the development =
firm has not yet hired a general contractor. It also has not started =
pre-construction marketing, routine for U.S. projects that will seek =
outside financing. But Kelleher said that during the third quarter he =
will start selling residences in the tower, which is expected to have =
1,200 luxury condominiums, retail space and underground parking.
>=20
> Real estate experts have estimated the project's cost could reach $2.4 =
billion, and at a time of rising construction costs, building such a =
tall structure is even more expensive because the higher it soars, the =
more complicated the engineering.
>=20
> "Tall buildings, especially when they are slender, must be stiffer to =
withstand the force of wind, which means that the structure calls for =
more steel, an expensive prospect," Fifield said.
>=20
> Furthermore, such towers require that more interior space be devoted =
to elevator service, so there's less space to sell. Murphy said he =
expects the Spire to yield only about 65 percent sellable space.
>=20
> Another factor that could increase the complexity and cost of the =
project would be excavating to build underground parking so close to the =
water. To dig below the water level while keeping the site dry, =
Shelbourne would use a process called slurry wall construction that =
calls for great skill and time, both costly commodities.
>=20
> Given the cost, Shelbourne might have to sell the units for $1,500 a =
square foot or more.
>=20
> "You can get that in New York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, London," =
Fifield said. "But Chicago is a kick-the-tires kind of town, so that =
will be more of a challenge."
>=20
> Kelleher plans to market the Spire worldwide in such places as Dubai, =
Russia's St. Petersburg, Beijing, Singapore and Madrid, in addition to =
New York and other parts of the U.S. Already, he said, "the number of =
inquiries exceeds the number of units. I have no doubt this project will =
sell out."

> Full text:
> Joseph Nacchio, who built Qwest Communications International Inc. into =
the nation's fourth-largest phone company and presided over a $100 =
billion drop in the company's market value before being ousted as chief =
executive in June 2002, was convicted of insider trading Thursday.
>=20
> A federal jury found Nacchio guilty of selling stock based on private =
warnings from top lieutenants that the company would miss revenue =
targets. Prosecutors said Nacchio made $101 million by illegally trading =
on inside information he withheld from investors.
>=20
> "If you don't tell, you can't sell," Assistant U.S. Atty. Colleen =
Conry told jurors in closing arguments.
>=20
> The jury found Nacchio guilty on 19 counts of insider trading for =
stock trades totaling $52 million. He was found not guilty of 23 counts =
relating to earlier trades totaling $49 million.
>=20
> The conviction of Nacchio, 57, caps a crackdown on corporate fraud =
that began when Enron Corp. collapsed in 2001. Hundreds of executives =
have been convicted, including three other former CEOs: Enron's Jeffrey =
Skilling, Bernard Ebbers of WorldCom Inc. and John Rigas, founder of =
Adelphia Communications Corp.
>=20
> Nacchio left the courthouse with his wife, Anne, without commenting. =
The panel of eight men and four women convicted Nacchio after six days =
of deliberations. He faces up to 10 years in prison and a $1 million =
fine on each count. U.S. District Judge Edward Nottingham set Nacchio's =
sentencing for July 27.
>=20
> Nacchio, who was CEO from 1997 to 2002, did not testify in his own =
defense at the four-week trial. Defense lawyers said he acted in good =
faith and believed Qwest would meet the projections after buying US West =
in 2000. Nacchio sold stock to diversify his portfolio, exercising =
options due to expire, his lawyers said.
>=20
> Before the trial Nacchio said he would present evidence that he =
believed Qwest would make its forecast because he alone knew of the =
company's chances of securing secret government contracts. Nacchio never =
presented such evidence because of unfavorable rulings from Nottingham.
>=20
> Nacchio joined Qwest from AT&T Inc. in 1997 and continued to return to =
his New Jersey home on weekends. Qwest directors ousted him in June 2002 =
as a criminal probe began. Nacchio was not charged with involvement in =
the accounting manipulations that later led Qwest to erase $2.5 billion =
in revenue.
>=20
> During the trial former Qwest President Afshin Mohebbi said he warned =
Nacchio in December 2000 that the targets would be a "huge stretch." =
Former Chief Financial Officer Robin Szeliga testified that she warned =
him of a $1 billion gap.
>=20
> Nacchio's lawyers said those discussions were about higher internal =
budgets, not public targets given to investors.
>=20
> Qwest made its earnings targets in the first two quarters, and Nacchio =
believed in forecasts first devised by investment bankers, defense =
attorney Herbert Stern said in his closing arguments.
>=20
> "Maybe his business projections didn't come true," Stern said. "Maybe =
the same optimism, energy, drive and ambition that built the company in =
the first place led him in the end to miscalculate what could be =
achieved in the terrible year of 2001. That may be true. But that is not =
a crime."
>=20
> Nacchio still faces a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange =
Commission that accuses him of directing a $3 billion accounting fraud. =
He also faces investor lawsuits.
>=20
> Qwest shares reached a closing high of $64 in March 2000 on =
expectations of a surge in the use of its fiber-optic network. Nacchio =
took advantage of investor optimism to load up on debt that financed a =
nationwide phone-and-data network. As other companies also rushed to =
capitalize on the expected growth in demand, a glut of network capacity =
developed, causing prices for sending calls and data signals to fall.

> It's not easy being green, especially if you want to build a home that =
produces its own power. Nor is it cheap.
>=20
> Since there are no large-scale green subdivisions, if you want to =
build a home that is kind to the environment, you often have to pay =
dearly because it's a custom project.
>=20
> Sam Garst, a financial adviser, paid a premium for his new house near =
Olympia, Wash. He has done the math and is satisfied with his projected =
return on investment.
>=20
> Since Garst was an environmental activist for nine years, he and his =
wife, Christine, didn't need convincing to make their home ecodynamic, =
in harmony with the local environment.
>=20
> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's recent 1,572- page =
report on global warming provides some of their rationale.
>=20
> The Garsts figured "this was our last move, so we wanted to do =
something out of the ordinary."
>=20
> They christened their castle "Zelonedom," a phonetic equivalent from =
Polish that means "green home."
>=20
> "We didn't do anything over the top," says Garst, referring to the =
house's use of existing technology, "but over time what we did will =
pay."
>=20
> An ecodynamic home is more than just a stick-built house with solar =
panels. It interacts with the environment to produce energy, staying =
warm in the winter and cool in the summer.
>=20
> These kinds of homes, which need to be mass produced, help address =
global warming. Buildings in the U.S. alone consume about 30 percent of =
all energy.
>=20
> The Garsts' house has no air conditioning; summers aren't extreme in =
their area of the Pacific Northwest. A geothermal heat pump that uses =
the Earth's natural temperature to create hot water for radiant, warm =
floors combined with air from the greenhouse keeps their home toasty =
when it's cold outside.
>=20
> They also paid attention to the building envelope, meaning they had =
walls, windows and ceiling spaces that preserve heat through extensive =
insulation.
>=20
> They used blown-in ceiling foam equivalent to an R-value of 56, which =
is a measurement of thermal efficiency. Most homes have roof R- values =
half of that rating or less.
>=20
> On top of their roof, two dozen 190-watt solar panels produce about =
4.5 kilowatts of electricity. To save on water consumption, they have =
dual-flush toilets and a cistern that stores 5,000 gallons of water, =
mostly for irrigation during the dry summers. They have also used =
recycled and environmentally friendly materials throughout the home.
>=20
> Like most houses employing solar energy these days, it wouldn't have =
made economic sense without extensive subsidies.
>=20
> The local power company paid them a $2,400 rebate on their solar =
panels in addition to a $2,000 federal tax credit. The cash back came in =
handy since the panels cost $27,000, or what you would pay for a modest =
sedan. The state also exempted the unit from its 8.2 percent sales tax.
>=20
> For power they generate, the electric utility will pay the Garsts a =
generous 15 cents per kilowatt hour, for the next 10 years. The =
electricity they produce on their own is almost free once they have =
recouped the cost of their system.
>=20
> As they are expected to produce about 5,500 kilowatt hours annually, =
that will earn them about $825. All told, they figure their total =
utility bills will run from $35 to $40 per month for the 2,400 =
square-foot, all-electric, three-bedroom home.
>=20
> "By our calculations," Garst says, "the first-year return on =
investment runs over 20 percent and the balance will earn about 5.6 =
percent a year."
>=20
> He says that's comparable to "a certificate of deposit in the bank and =
close to our 6.25 percent mortgage rate. We figure we'll be =
cash-positive for the first 10 years."
>=20
> Garst believes the value of the house will go up.

> Full text:
> About four years after Starbucks rebuffed efforts to set up shop in =
downtown Roselle -- even after an offer of rent-free space from a =
developer -- the coffee retail giant has approached the village with a =
change of heart.
>=20
> Now the village hopes Starbucks can help solve its struggling downtown =
retail market.
>=20
> Roselle Mayor Gayle Smolinski said, "There were no incentives offered =
at all" this time, but the village's Planning and Zoning Commission =
recently approved changes to the site the chain picked out.
>=20
> After a public hearing, the commission this month voted to allow the =
site at Roselle Road and Main Street -- previously designated for a =
restaurant -- to be split to allow Starbucks to have a store with =
drive-through service on one side with a small bank on the other.
>=20
> Now the proposal is on the fast-track, going before a committee of the =
whole meeting next week and likely on the full board's agenda soon =
after.
>=20
> The La Grange-based Gammonley Group, which leases retail storefronts =
in Roselle, had offered Starbucks rent-free space for four to five years =
as an incentive to open a store in 2003, but the chain declined.
>=20
> With the new deal, Gammonley worked up plans to divide the site, with =
a 1,900-square-foot Starbucks on one part, and the two-story bank on the =
other.
>=20
> Although condo projects downtown have done well, retail planned for =
nearly 60,000 square feet in projects such as the Village Crossing, Main =
Street Station and the forthcoming Park Street Crossing has not.
>=20
> Officials hope the Seattle-based Starbucks, the first "brand- name" =
retailer to commit to the western suburb, will create a domino effect.
>=20
> "Starbucks does its homework very well and often moves very slowly =
before committing to an area," said community development director =
Patrick Watkins. "There is name recognition there, and other businesses =
tend to see that as a sign a particular site is successful."
>=20
> Richard Gammonley, executive vice president of the Gammonley Group, =
said terms of the agreement were "acceptable to all parties," though he =
would not describe details.
>=20
> Gammonley said Starbucks' 2003 rejection of the area was because the =
company wasn't in the "expansion mode."
>=20
> Officials for Starbucks confirmed the company's interest in the =
Roselle site but would not discuss details of a proposed deal.
>=20
> As for Roselle residents, Watkins said that recent marketing surveys =
revealed that having a coffee shop downtown was at the top of many =
residents' lists.
>=20
> Now, he said, "We're hoping to attract other businesses that reflect =
our surveys, including a breakfast and lunch restaurant and a couple of =
specialty stores."

> Full text:
> A preacher's wife testified at her murder trial Wednesday that her =
husband abused her physically and sexually, but she said the shotgun =
fired accidentally as she pointed it at him in their parsonage bedroom.
>=20
> Mary Winkler heard a "boom" but she said she did not pull the trigger, =
prompting prosecutor Walt Freeland to ask her later if she understood =
how a trigger worked.
>=20
> "You know that pulling a trigger is what makes it go boom?" Freeland =
asked.
>=20
> "Yes, sir," Winkler replied. She said she remembered holding the gun, =
but not getting it from the closet.
>=20
> She said she just wanted to talk to her husband, Matthew, when she =
went into their bedroom that day in March 2006, but she was too =
terrified. "He just could be so mean," she said.
>=20
> But, she told Freeland, her husband did "nothing" for which he =
deserved to die.
>=20
> Her depiction of her marriage contrasts radically with the description =
by the prosecution, whose witnesses described Winkler as a good father =
and husband. The couple's 9-year-old daughter, Patricia, testified that =
she never saw him mistreat her mother.
>=20
> Winkler, 31, was fatally shot in the back. A day later, his wife was =
arrested on the Alabama coast 340 miles away, driving the family =
mini-van with her three young daughters inside.
>=20
> Winkler said she planned to return to Selmer but wanted time alone =
with her daughters. "All I knew was that the stupid gun had went off, =
and nobody would believe me and they would just take my girls away from =
me," she said.
>=20
> She said she still loved her husband.
>=20
> "I was ashamed," she said, explaining why she told no one of the =
abuse. "I didn't want anybody to know about Matthew."
>=20
> Winkler testified her husband punched her in the face, kicked her at =
times and refused to grant a divorce. Shortly after they were married, =
"he just got me down and told me that I was his wife and we were family =
now, and he just screamed and hollered," she testified.
>=20
> Speaking about their sex life, she spoke quietly and hesitantly, with =
eyes downcast. She said Matthew Winkler forced her to view pornography, =
dress "slutty" and have sex she considered unnatural.
>=20
> The defense showed the jury a pair of white platform-heel shoes and a =
wig Winkler said her husband wanted her to wear during sex. She =
described a skirt he wanted her to wear as "very, very short." =
Pornographic photos she identified as coming from their home computer =
were entered as evidence.
>=20
> In his closing argument, defense attorney Steve Farese said the =
prosecution "absolutely, positively" did not prove Mary Winkler intended =
to kill her husband, something required for a conviction of first-degree =
murder. But Farese left open the possibility that she could be guilty of =
a lesser crime.
>=20
> If convicted of first-degree murder, Winkler could be sentenced to up =
to 60 years in prison. Farese said the judge would decide if the jury =
could consider lesser charges such as voluntary manslaughter.
>=20
> A psychologist testified Winkler could not have formed the intent to =
commit a crime because of her compromised mental condition. She suffered =
from mild depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, which started =
at age 13 when her sister died and was worsened by her husband's abuse, =
Dr. Lynn Zager said.
>=20
> Last week, prosecutors played an audiotape in which Winkler told =
authorities that her husband criticized her constantly and that she got =
tired of it and just "snapped."
>=20
> The prosecution has also said Winkler was under stress because bank =
managers were closing in on a check-kiting scheme she wanted to conceal =
from her husband. But Winkler said her husband knew about the financial =
problems.
>=20
> The jury will begin deliberating Thursday, the judge said.

> Full text:
> With the aldermanic election over and new faces aligned with the union =
movement coming to the City Council, the chances of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. =
fulfilling its ambition of expanding in Chicago appear to have suffered =
a blow.
>=20
> But wait.
>=20
> Wal-Mart's point man for Chicago, Roderick Scott, said Wednesday that =
the world's largest retailer is still actively looking for more sites in =
the city despite the fact that the union-aligned members of the council =
potentially have the clout to keep it at bay. Wal-Mart opened its first =
Chicago store on the West Side last September.
>=20
> The battle between those who see economic development in the arrival =
of big-box retailers like Wal-Mart and those who see economic =
destruction in its wage practices was gripping and hard- fought from the =
start. And there appears to be no reason the great Wal-Mart debate won't =
continue.
>=20
> "What we have got to do now is meet with the new members of the City =
Council to further determine how we can best serve our Chicago =
customers," said Scott.
>=20
> The unions have been on one side of a dispute that could block =
Wal-Mart's expansion in the city. They are supporting legislation that =
would force the company to pay its workers more in wages and benefits. =
Wal-Mart has threatened not to expand in Chicago if the legislation =
passes.
>=20
> With at least four more union-aligned aldermen joining the City =
Council, and Ald. Joe Moore (49th) surviving a close runoff, it looks =
like labor won enough support in Tuesday's election to continue the =
quest to pass a "big-box" ordinance that would set higher wage =
standards. Moore was the chief sponsor of the ordinance that passed the =
City Council last summer, only to be vetoed by Mayor Richard Daley after =
three aldermen switched votes to support him.
>=20
> In Wal-Mart's favor is the fact that Ald. Howard Brookins (21st), who =
won a runoff against union-backed Leroy Jones, has been fighting to get =
a Wal-Mart in his ward for three years.
>=20
> Brookins now thinks it's "likely" that Wal-Mart will come to his =
neighborhood. And Pat Dowell, the 3rd Ward candidate who unseated =
anti-big-box-ordinance Ald. Dorothy Tillman, has said publicly she =
favors retail development.
>=20
> Even Ald. Anthony Beale (9th), who was not in the runoff but who voted =
for the big-box ordinance last summer, is putting out the welcome mat =
for Wal-Mart to come into his South Side neighborhood.
>=20
> It's no coincidence that Wal-Mart's first Chicago store opened on the =
West Side site of a former shampoo factory and the retailer is looking =
at opening other sites on land that housed steel plants not long ago. =
Manufacturing jobs are disappearing in the Midwest and retail jobs are =
on the rise.
>=20
> Indeed, a site that housed a state-of-the art steel processing plant =
in the Chatham neighborhood in Brookins' ward is now home to a =
developing retail power center that could eventually include a Wal- =
Mart.
>=20
> Developer Archon Group LP, a unit of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., has =
already broken ground on a 420,000-square-foot shopping center at 83rd =
Street and Stewart Avenue. A Lowe's home improvement store signed on as =
one anchor last month. Archon is searching for a second anchor. =
Wal-Mart, which attempted to sign on to the project in 2004, is believed =
to still be interested in the site.
>=20
> Neither Wal-Mart's Scott nor officials at Archon would comment on =
Wal-Mart's plans.
>=20
> "I understand the whole issue of a living wage, but when you don't =
have any economic development taking place, you're looking to see some," =
said Lorri Baldwin, president of the West Chatham Improvement =
Association. "I'd like to see a Wal-Mart come in. I have to drive to =
[the Burbank area] now to go to Wal-Mart. It would be a great =
opportunity for our youth and seniors who would like to work part time."
>=20
> Wal-Mart attempted to open a store in Chatham several years ago but =
was prevented from doing so when the City Council voted against rezoning =
the manufacturing site for commercial use. In September 2004 the =
project's developer, Monroe Investment Partners LLC, sent a letter to =
members of the City Council, including zoning committee chairman Ald. =
William Banks, stating that Wal-Mart was no longer involved in the =
project.
>=20
> "Wal-Mart is not now, and will not be, a part of our development of =
the Ryerson site," the letter stated in bold type.
>=20
> With Wal-Mart out of the picture, the letter paved the way for the =
City Council to ultimately approve rezoning the site for commercial use. =
Archon later took over the project, and Monroe stayed on as a joint =
venture partner.

> Large-company stocks, led by major banks, advanced Wednesday, enabling =
the Dow Jones industrial average to reach a record closing high.
>=20
> But for the second straight day, there were more losing stocks than =
winners on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq markets.
>=20
> The Dow hit a record despite disappointing quarterly reports and =
forecasts late Tuesday by two well-known technology companies, =
International Business Machines and Yahoo. But after the close of =
trading, online auction service eBay rose after posting better-than- =
expected results.
>=20
> The Dow rose 30.80 points, to 12,803.84. It was the 32nd record high =
for the Dow since Oct. 3 and the 13th advance by the index in the last =
14 trading sessions.
>=20
> Boeing, JPMorgan and Caterpillar were the biggest contributors to the =
Dow's advance Wednesday. IBM, a Dow component, fell more than 2 percent.
>=20
> The Standard & Poor's 500 index edged higher, led by financial, =
industrial and utility stocks. JPMorgan rose $1.89, to $52.07, on a =
strong quarterly earnings report. Wells Fargo and Bank of America were =
also major gainers in the S&P 500 index. Yahoo, which fell $3.78, to =
$28.31, was the biggest loser among the S&P 500 stocks.
>=20
> The Nasdaq composite index slipped 6.45, to 2510.50. The Russell 2000 =
index of small-company stocks eased 4.58, to 824.38. The Dow Jones =
utilities average established a record closing high for the second day =
in a row.
>=20
> NYSE trading volume reached 1.61 billion shares. Losers outnumbered =
winners by a 9-7 ratio among NYSE-listed stocks. Nasdaq trading volume =
totaled 2.05 billion shares, as losers topped winners by nearly a 3-2 =
ratio.
>=20
> Treasury securities rose for a third straight day, reflecting fresh =
reports about the weak housing market. Oil and gasoline futures closed =
higher in New York.
>=20
> The dollar dropped to a 26-year low against the British pound.
>=20
> LOCAL NEWS: Chicago-based money manager Nuveen Investments received a =
"buy" rating from Banc of America. Shares rose $1.23, to $50.85.
>=20
> -Wachovia Capital Markets upgraded its rating on Peoria-based =
Caterpillar to "outperform" from "market perform." Shares gained $1.71, =
to $69.37.

>=20
> Long-range plan for corridor OKd
>=20
> Village officials Tuesday night approved an amendment to Bartlett's =
comprehensive plan that officials said is a model for future =
development.
>=20
> The West Bartlett Road Corridor, a comprehensive design plan, will be =
used during the next five to 10 years to create what Jim Plonczynski, =
community development director, called, "an architecturally pleasant =
landscape gateway" into the downtown area of Bartlett.
>=20
> "This plan covers landscape improvements, bike paths, frontages and =
streetscapes and will serve as a blueprint for developers as projects =
come into the village," Plonczynski said. "Usually when we put these =
plans together, we're talking about long-range things that would take =
five to 10 years to complete."
>=20
> The corridor runs from Illinois Highway 25 on the west to downtown on =
the east. Plonczynski said the launching point of the project will be at =
the intersection of Naperville and West Bartlett Roads, where Cook =
County plans to widen the intersection, and add traffic signals, turn =
lanes, a median and a bike path.
>=20
> The new fire station that will be built at Spitzer and West Bartlett =
Roads will be one of the first Bartlett projects to come under the =
corridor plan.

> 28 owners face water project fees
>=20
> Hinsdale residents whose homes are slated for one of four local storm =
water projects have 60 days to derail village plans to make them pay 80 =
percent of the $372,000 total cost.
>=20
> By state law, residents can force the village to abandon the proposed =
charges -- if not the proposed drainage improvements -- by submitting a =
petition signed by 51 percent of the property owners and 51 percent of =
the voters registered as living at the affected homes.
>=20
> The 28 affected properties are along Oak Street between 8th and 9th =
Streets; on Briargate Terrace, Canterbury Court and The Pines in the =
Fullersburg neighborhood; on Orchard Place and Oak Street near Chicago =
Avenue; and near the intersection of Fuller Road and Elm Street. =
Assistant Village Manager Doug Cooper said Tuesday night that affected =
property owners have been notified of the proposed charges.

> New ordinance targets gang graffiti
>=20
> In an effort to address possible gang-related graffiti issues in =
Itasca, officials Tuesday night approved a new ordinance to provide =
local police with guidelines regarding reporting of graffiti, its =
removal and possible fines.
>=20
> Police Chief Scott Heher said that a number of villages in the area =
have adopted similar ordinances and that Itasca wanted "to be proactive =
regarding graffiti issues."
>=20
> "It's sort of like the broken window metaphor," Heher said. "If you =
see one broken window somewhere that's not repaired, before long, you'll =
have another. When graffiti remains visible, it sometimes leads to a =
game of one-upmanship, and we don't want that."
>=20
> The ordinance allows police to inform property owners regarding =
graffiti on their building and to establish a time limit for its =
removal. It also gives the village the right to remove the graffiti and =
carries fines of $250 for the first incident of non-compliance to remove =
the markings to $500 for second offenses and beyond.
>=20
> In a related matter, trustees also approved an amendment to an =
existing ordinance regarding Itasca's traffic code for penalties and =
violations. Under the amendment, a local village prosecutor will be =
assigned to court cases rather than having them processed by the state's =
attorney's office.

commercial development along Butterfield near Batavia Road. The city =
hopes to see a restaurant resurrected along the west bank of the DuPage =

boarded-up piano store now occupies the site.

> Full text:
> Almost any homeowner will tell you there's something they'd tweak if =
they could about their home's design: more storage, a bigger kitchen or =
higher ceilings. The same holds true for property managers and others =
working with condominium associations, who regularly spot ways that =
buildings could function better.
>=20
> "Some designs are not completely thought out by the developer and the =
board is left holding the bag," said association consultant Shirley =
Feldman of Association Advocates in Chicago and Park Ridge.
>=20
> If security expert Vic Weisskopf built condominiums, he would be sure =
to designate areas where packages are safe until owners can pick them =
up.
>=20
> "You'd be amazed how many very expensive buildings don't have anything =
like it," he said. "Someone's Rolex watch could be sitting in the =
hallway in front of their door.
>=20
> "You'll find buildings with no place for a maintenance man to store =
his supplies," Weisskopf added. "Sometimes you'll have a slop sink, but =
that's not enough. In Chicago, you at least need space for a snow shovel =
if not a big snow blower."
>=20
> Office space for maintenance and management personnel sometimes can be =
created in the garage, Feldman said.
>=20
> "But then you've got people breathing car fumes, and you've got to =
have heating and cooling and a phone line and where is that person going =
to go to the bathroom?" she said.
>=20
> Other quirks Feldman has noted include dog runs placed directly under =
resident balconies and a 200-unit building with storage for only a =
handful of bicycles.
>=20
> "Sometimes the trash receptacles are located where other people in the =
neighborhood can use them and the association pays a huge bill for waste =
pickup that isn't theirs," she said.
>=20
> There's never enough room to put the snow, especially when it stacks =
up, said Sherm Fields, president of Acres Group snow removal and =
landscaping company in Plainfield.
>=20
> Some associations have so little unoccupied land that they pay extra =
to transport their snow off-site, he said.
>=20
> As for landscaping, a common problem is too little diversity of plant =
material, he said.
>=20
> "Sometimes developers put in only a couple of types of trees and =
shrubs, which makes the whole association more susceptible to disease =
and pests," he said. "If one type is stricken, you lose a lot."
>=20
> Civil engineer Kami Farahmandpour of Building Technology Consultants =
in Arlington Heights would like to see Chicago's residential high-rises =
built for easier exterior maintenance. Local ordinance says the facades =
must be inspected every few years. The more intricate the architectural =
detail, the more difficult and costly it is to put up scaffolding to do =
the job.
>=20
> "In many cases, commercial buildings are designed with scaffolding =
davits that allow quick installation of scaffolding equipment, thereby =
reducing costs," he said. "Some even have built- in scaffolding =
equipment that is permanently mounted to rails on the roof. However, =
such equipment is rarely seen in residential community developments."
>=20
> Beth Lloyd, president of the Association of Condominium, Townhome and =
Homeowners Associations and a real estate broker for Coldwell Banker, =
has yet to unravel the mysteries of association parking.
>=20
> "Some condo buildings have outdoor parking lots that require you to =
walk halfway around the building to gain entrance," she said. "And it =
would help to have addresses posted in large enough numbers, =
unobstructed by trees and posts, on several sides of the buildings."
>=20
> Visitors and prospective buyers appreciate clearly marked parking =
spaces, so they don't inadvertently take someone else's, she said.
>=20
> "Some associations use a code to identify the unit parking space for =
security reasons," she said. "That may be a good thing, but it's awful =
for others to do the right thing if there is little or no visitor =
parking."
>=20
> Shared driveways, a growing trend in townhome communities, are a =
navigational challenge, she said.
>=20
> "At night it's very difficult to see which way the driveway turns," =
she said. "This takes a toll on mailbox posts and street signs, not to =
mention dents on cars and mangled landscape."
>=20
> Parking bumpers placed too close to sidewalks is a pet peeve of =
property manager Erica Horndasch of Legum & Norman Mid-West in Glen =
Ellyn.
>=20
> The tendency is for drivers to stop when their tires touch the bumper, =
and the fronts of their cars hang over the sidewalk. Moving the bumpers =
further away from the sidewalk gives pedestrians more walking area and =
might provide space for shoveled snow, she said.

> Full text:
> American Airlines said Wednesday that it swung to a profit in the =
first quarter, as the nation's largest carrier overcame stubbornly high =
fuel prices and winter storms that scrambled flight schedules.
>=20
> The Ft. Worth-based airline reported earnings of $81 million, or 30 =
cents a share, meeting estimates. A year ago it lost $92 million, or 49 =
cents a share. Revenue rose 1.6 percent, to $5.43 billion, slightly =
below Wall Street's expectations.
>=20
> The profit was American's first since 2000 in the first quarter, =
historically the weakest for the airline industry. Chairman and Chief =
Executive Gerard Arpey said the results built on American's work in =
2006, when it earned its first full-year profit after five money-losing =
years.
>=20
> "It was right on the money," said analyst Ray Neidl of Calyon =
Securities. "The industry looks as if it's back on track."
>=20
> American's traffic rose 1.1 percent on international routes, compared =
with a 2.5 percent drop on domestic flights. The airline gets 30 percent =
more revenue per square foot in business- and first- class cabins of =
flights to Europe than in coach, according to Dan Garton, executive vice =
president for marketing. American's jets averaged 78.1 percent occupancy =
in the quarter, up from 77.2 percent a year earlier.
>=20
> Stock of the airline's parent, AMR Corp., added $1.15, to $31.96, on =
the New York Stock Exchange.
>=20
> In other earnings news:
>=20
> -JPMorgan Chase & Co. reported a 55 percent jump in first- quarter =
profit, reflecting strength across most of its primary business lines, =
though it increased reserves to offset subprime mortgage losses.
>=20
> The New York-based bank said net income was $4.8 billion, or $1.34 a =
share, up from $3.1 billion, or 86 cents a share, a year earlier. The =
most recent results easily beat estimates of $1.02 a share. Revenue =
climbed 25 percent, to nearly $19 billion.
>=20
> "JPMorgan blew away even my expectations," said William Fitzpatrick, =
an analyst at Johnson Asset Management in Racine, Wis.
>=20
> The bank said it was raising its quarterly dividend 4 cents, to 38 =
cents a share. It was the first dividend increase in six years, said =
Chief Financial Officer Michael J. Cavanagh. The bank also authorized a =
$10 billion share repurchase program.
>=20
> Provision for credit losses rose $207 million, to $292 million, mostly =
because of higher losses in its subprime mortgage portfolio. Still, the =
bank called its exposure to the troubled subprime market, which involves =
home loans to high-risk borrowers, to be "manageable."
>=20
> Shares of JPMorgan gained $1.89, to $52.07, on the NYSE.
>=20
> -EBay Inc. said first-quarter net income climbed 52 percent, to $377.2 =
million, or 27 cents a share, from $248.3 million, or 17 cents a share, =
a year earlier. Excluding items, the San Jose, Calif.- based online =
auction firm would have earned 33 cents a share, beating estimates by 3 =
cents a share. Revenue increased 27 percent, to $1.77 billion.
>=20
> "They're still the gorilla," said Rachel Wakefield, a portfolio =
manager for Coldstream Capital Management in Portland, Ore. "I just =
don't see anywhere else the sellers can go in spite of the price hike."
>=20
> Auction revenue per listing rose 20 percent from a year earlier, =
helped by a fee increase. Overseas revenue surged 38 percent, outpacing =
an 18 percent gain in the U.S.
>=20
> The report came out after the close of trading.

> Owners who lose a pet don't have to deal with their grief alone as =
Molly Shannon's character does in "Year of the Dog." A non- profit group =
called the Association for Pet Loss and Bereavement offers online coping =
strategies at aplb.org for people experiencing pet death as well as =
those who anticipate losing a pet soon. [FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM]

> Sending your pets off in style is hardly a modern idea: Last year, =
researchers uncovered a 1,000-year-old pet cemetery near Lima, Peru, =
where 43 mummified dogs had been buried with treats alongside their =
pre-Incan owners. Here are some of the ways today's animal caretakers =
can deal with their companions' deaths:
>=20
> * Pet funerals: Pet funeral homes offer everything from pre-need =
planning to viewings and visitations. If you prefer a resting place in =
cyberspace, look on the Web at virtualpetcemetery.org, in-memory- =
of-pets.com and rainbowbridge.com.
>=20
> * Urns and memorials: A metal canister on the mantel is no longer your =
only choice for a cremated animal's ashes. Web sites offer other =
options, such as the pendants shaped like bones or balls of yarn (left) =
found at allaboutpeturns.com. Two more sites are custompeturns.com and =
lucythewonderdog.com.
>=20
> * Pet preservation: Companies such as Mansfield's Pet Preservation =
Specialist (petpreservations.com) can freeze-dry your companion in any =
desired position. The process takes about four months, and a good-size =
German shepherd costs about $1,500.
>=20
> * DNA banking: You can bank your kitty or doggie or hamster DNA in =
liquid nitrogen at a facility such as a Viagen (viagen.com), but just =
remember: Variations in environment can produce genetically identical =
animals during cloning that behave differently and sometimes even look =
different. [NEWSDAY]
>=20
> The pain of pet loss
>=20
> Owners who lose a pet don't have to deal with their grief alone as =
Molly Shannon's character does in "Year of the Dog." A non- profit group =
called the Association for Pet Loss and Bereavement offers online coping =
strategies at aplb.org for people experiencing pet death as well as =
those who anticipate losing a pet soon. [FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM]

> Most bands post music online in hopes that their work will fall on =
interested ears. With a bit of talent, a group of newcomers can =
accumulate a sizeable fan base in a matter of months, or even weeks.
>=20

Mourning.
>=20
> How their music reached new fans is nothing new. Whom their music =
reached is a bit less ordinary. Shortly after posting songs on MySpace =
in late 2005, the band was contacted by MTV.
>=20
> "We really thought it was a prank," said guitarist and songwriter Max =
Steger, 18 of Bannockburn. The call was not a joke, and the group soon =
signed a deal with MTV that landed its songs on several of the network's =
shows, including "Pimp My Ride."
>=20
> By then, Blacktop's MySpace page was receiving a bit more traffic, and =
one of the band's new fans turned out to be Adam Duritz of the Counting =
Crows.
>=20
> "We heard Adam liked our music shortly after we put it on MySpace," =
Steger said.
>=20
> The group was asked to meet with Duritz when the Crows came to the =
First Midwest Bank Amphitheatre in August, and they ended up having an =
amazing time.

> Mark Silverman laid out Wednesday all the goodies the new Big Ten =
Network has to offer.
>=20
> The network president talked about a daily news-and-feature studio =
show -- a Big Ten "SportsCenter," if you will -- plus live reports from =
each campus, coach's shows and rebroadcasts of classic games. The =
centerpiece will be a slew of live games, including 35 in football and =
105 in basketball.
>=20
> If you think the Big Ten Network is going to get stuck with dumpy =
games, guess again. In football ABC still will get the first pick, but =
there will be many weeks when the Big Ten Network will have the second =
or third selection over ESPN and ESPN2.
>=20
> It will be all Big Ten, all the time. Nirvana, if you can't get enough =
of the Illini, Wildcats, Buckeyes, Wolverines, etc.
>=20
> But there's a big question: Who will be able to see the Big Ten =
Network when it launches in August?
>=20
> Silverman said the network is in the process of negotiating deals with =
the various cable and satellite outlets. DirecTV already has agreed to =
carry the network on its Total Choice package. Some small cable =
companies also have signed on, he said.
>=20
> But much work needs to be done in securing the bigger systems, =
including Comcast, the major cable carrier in the Chicago area.
>=20
> Silverman said repeatedly he is "very confident all the deals will get =
done." But it hardly is a slam dunk given the distribution problems NFL =
Network and the Major League Baseball "Extra Innings" package recently =
have encountered.
>=20
> The Big Ten's goal is to be on expanded basic cable on all the systems =
within the eight states that make up the conference; 18.1 million homes =
have cable or satellite in the region. It would appear on the digital =
platform elsewhere.
>=20
> According to Sports Business Journal, the network is asking cable =
providers to pay $1.10 per subscriber in the Big Ten area. That price is =
said to have major cable companies balking.
>=20
> The cable operators don't want to pass on additional fees to their =
customers. While ESPN charges $3 per subscriber, NFL Network receives =
only 70 cents per subscriber. Somebody is going to have pay the $1.10 =
per subscriber the Big Ten is seeking.
>=20
> There is another potential stumbling block. Many major cable companies =
often say they don't have room on their basic tiers to add another =
channel. NFL Network runs on Comcast's digital tier in the Chicago area, =
even though it is airing regular-season NFL games.
>=20
> Silverman wouldn't comment on the specifics of the pending talks.
>=20
> "We plan on negotiating behind closed doors," Silverman said. "We've =
had encouraging conversations. We don't plan on having any discontent."
>=20
> Silverman has reason to be optimistic now because he still is =
relatively early in the negotiating process. But things could get heated =
if deals aren't reached before August.
>=20
> NFL Network went on a campaign last fall to apply pressure on several =
large holdouts to add the channel to their systems. There were areas in =
Wisconsin that couldn't get the Packers-Vikings game in December because =
their cable outlets didn't carry NFL Network.
>=20
> The Big Ten Network obviously hopes to avoid that situation. But if =
there is trouble, it holds a fairly strong trump card: the fans. Big Ten =
fans are passionate and they want it all.
>=20
> Imagine a cable operator in Columbus not carrying the Big Ten Network =
on its system, thus forcing local fans to miss an Ohio State- Iowa =
football game. The reaction wouldn't be pretty.
>=20
> Public pressure can be a beautiful thing. It recently forced MLB to =
cut a deal with the cable companies to add the "Extra Innings" package. =
Initially baseball had wanted to do an exclusive deal with DirecTV.
>=20
> Unless the Big Ten Network reaches agreements soon with the major =
cable providers, the negotiations will be a storyline through the =
summer. Usually these things have a way of getting worked out, but as =
the NFL Network has shown, there are no guarantees.
>=20
> If August comes around and you aren't receiving the Big Ten Network on =
your system, you know what to do. Get on the phone to your cable =
provider and blast your school's fight song in its ear.

> Full text:
> Motorola Inc. on Wednesday reported its first quarterly loss in 2 1/2 =
years, unveiled a big loss in its global cell phone market share and =
signaled that the second quarter isn't going to be much better.
>=20
> Still, investors pushed the beleaguered company's stock up a bit, =
apparently seeing hints of a turnaround, or maybe just breathing a sigh =
of relief because news from the cell phone giant wasn't as bad as some =
expected.
>=20
> Schaumburg-based Motorola maintained Wednesday that a reversal of =
fortunes is on tap in 2007's second half. Several stock analysts remain =
skeptical. "I think that's extremely challenging," said Brant Thompson, =
an analyst at Goldman Sachs. "They just have some really tough =
sledding."
>=20
> Motorola's woes have led some observers to speculate that Edward =
Zander may not be all that secure in his position as chief executive.
>=20
> But Wednesday, a Motorola director said in an interview with the =
Tribune that the board is solidly behind Zander, with no inclination to =
give him the ax.
>=20
> "In the context of [being] a board member, I can tell you Ed has =
unanimous support," said Thomas Meredith, who is also acting chief =
financial officer. Zander, Meredith added, has "created huge value for =
shareholders during his tenure."
>=20
> Zander and Motorola rode the rise of the Razr cell phone well into =
2006, with Motorola's stock peaking around $26 last October, nearly $13 =
more than when Zander took over in January 2004. But since last fall, =
the Razr has become a commodity, and Motorola is faced with a paucity of =
compelling high-end phones -- the kind that command higher prices and =
higher profits.
>=20
> Motorola rocked Wall Street in early January by announcing its phone =
division's fourth-quarter profits would fall well short of forecasts. =
Then, on March 21, Motorola warned that its rapidly decaying phone =
business would cause the firm to actually lose money during 2007's first =
quarter.
>=20
> On the heels of the bad fourth quarter, New York-based maverick =
financier Carl Icahn announced he was seeking a seat on Motorola's board =
-- much to management's displeasure.
>=20
> Now one of Motorola's largest stockholders, Icahn has since upped his =
pressure on Motorola. Wednesday, in a second letter to Motorola =
shareholders, he said that the company's earnings conference call =
"reaffirmed my belief that Motorola has a passive and reactive board."
>=20
> The company has defended its board as being highly engaged in the =
firm's operations.
>=20
> Motorola on Wednesday reported a net loss of $181 million, or 9 cents =
per share, including charges of 11 cents per share for one- time items. =
Those results were in line with Motorola's warning March 21 that its =
cell phone operation was bleeding red ink. The company's total quarterly =
sales of $9.4 billion were a bit above forecast.
>=20
> Motorola's strategy shift this winter -- it won't chase cell phone =
market share if it's not profitable -- was borne out in its =
first-quarter report Wednesday.
>=20
> Motorola, the world's second-largest cell phone-maker, estimates that =
its slice of the global market will be 17.5 percent, down from at least =
22.1 percent during the fourth quarter, and the lowest in 21 months.
>=20
> The pursuit of "market share at all costs," Zander told analysts in a =
conference call Wednesday, "in retrospect, that was our big error in =
judgment."
>=20
> But there's potentially a cost, some analysts say, to giving up market =
share -- even if it's unprofitable in the short term.
>=20
> Under Ron Garriques, head of Motorola's cell-phone division until he =
left abruptly for another job in February, Motorola operated under the =
idea that retaining market share was necessary, even during a down =
cycle, Citigroup analyst Daryl Armstrong said in a recent interview.
>=20
> Garriques' idea was that "shelf space" had to be maintained until the =
arrival of the next hit products, Armstrong said, under the rationale =
that building back lost market share costs three times as much as it =
cost to win it in the first place, Armstrong said.
>=20
> It's a conundrum. "I can see where Zander is coming from," Armstrong =
said, in that there's certainly logic in not pursuing market share at =
the expense of profits. But if Garriques' theory is right, Motorola =
could get "the worst of both worlds" -- lower share, without higher =
profits.
>=20
> In reaction to Wednesday's earnings report, investors bid up =
Motorola's stock by 27 cents, or 1.5 percent, to close at $18.22.
>=20
> "The [first-quarter report] wasn't as bad as people feared it would =
be," said James Faucette, a stock analyst at Pacific Crest Securities. =
Or as Brian Modoff, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities put it, =
"People are thinking the worst is over."
>=20
> Motorola reiterated Wednesday that it expects its cell-phone operation =
to start gradually improving during the second half of 2007 and turn a =
profit for the whole year.
>=20
> Yet Modoff, like several other analysts, has his doubts, saying he =
expects Motorola's cell-phone division to lose money through the third =
quarter and only break even in the fourth.
>=20
> The company anticipates that new models will help refresh what =
analysts say is a tired phone lineup. Cost cutting will help too. =
Motorola announced in January it planned to slash 3,500 jobs, resulting =
in $400 million in savings. Company executives Wednesday said more =
cost-cutting moves may be announced by June 1.

> Full text:
> In the 1980s, David V. Dootson joined a group of American business =
executives, traveling to cities throughout Europe and the Far East, and =
seeking to strengthen communications among the United States and other =
countries.
>=20
> On a trip to England the group visited Prime Minister Margaret =
Thatcher, and on another they met with Russian President Mikhail S. =
Gorbachev, soon after he initiated a policy of restructuring and a =
climate of openness within the former communist regime.
>=20
> "He traveled all over the globe, meeting businessmen from everywhere =
and talking with leaders of many countries," said his son, David P. =
"When he came home there were always stories to tell."
>=20
> Mr. Dootson, 70, of Oak Brook, previously of Chicago and Lake Forest, =
a longtime employee of Sears, Roebuck & Co. and former president of the =
Sears Investment Management Co., died after a long battle with =
Alzheimer's disease, Monday, April 16, in ManorCare nursing facility in =
Westmont.
>=20
> Born in Chicago, Mr. Dootson grew up in Libertyville and graduated =
from Libertyville High School. In 1959, he received a bachelor's degree =
in business administration from Lake Forest College, where he was in the =
theater program.
>=20
> After college, Mr. Dootson worked for two years in the trust =
department at Continental Bank in Chicago.
>=20
> "Finance and working with numbers were always his strengths, something =
he was very good at," his son said.
>=20
> Mr. Dootson began his career with Sears, Roebuck & Co. in the early =
1960s, when he went to work in the investment department of Allstate =
Insurance Co., which at the time was owned by Sears. He headed =
Allstate's investment group division before becoming executive director =
of investments for Sears.
>=20
> In the early 1970s, Mr. Dootson was appointed president of the Sears =
Investment Management Company, where he remained until retiring in 1993.
>=20
> "Dave was a wonderful guy and a lot of fun to work with," said David =
Williams, a former vice president with SIMCO.
>=20
> During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Mr. Dootson also served as a =
trustee at Lake Forest College, where he received a distinguished =
service award for his contributions, family members said.
>=20
> Other survivors include his wife, Dorothy Brooke Raleigh; five =
daughters, Deidre Roberts, Susan, Elizabeth Vaidya; Mary Scheidegger and =
Kathy; two stepdaughters, Pamela Naber and Debbie Porcelli and 11 =
grandchildren.
>=20
> Visitation will be held from 9 a.m. until the time of services at 11 =
a.m. Thursday in Toon Funeral Home, 4920 Main St., Downers Grove.

> Full text:
> A gate at Naval Station Great Lakes that North Chicago officials were =
counting on to help revive a blighted business district will remain =
closed, a spokeswoman for the base said this week.
>=20
> The base entrance fronting the new King Drive crossing of the Union =
Pacific railroad tracks will open only for special occasions, and the =
main gate about a mile south will continue to be the principal entrance =
and exit for the base, Lt. Cmdr. Melissa Scheuermann said.
>=20
> The city and the federal government are spending about $6 million to =
rebuild the King Drive-Sheridan Road intersection and railroad crossing. =
The city has bought most of the property along Sheridan near Great Lakes =
and is planning a massive commercial development called Sheridan =
Crossing on 40 acres across the tracks from the naval base exit known as =
Gate 4.
>=20
> The city was counting on the opening of Gate 4 to make it easier for =
thousands of sailors and civilian federal workers to reach the Sheridan =
Crossing development.
>=20
> "It's very disappointing," North Chicago Mayor Leon Rockingham Jr. =
said. "My understanding was that the gate would be open. If we had known =
it was going to be closed, we might not have gone forward with the =
[intersection] project."
>=20
> Rockingham said the Navy's decision was revealed about two weeks ago =
during engineering discussions about the opening of the intersection.
>=20
> Project stakeholders want "to bridge the gap between the Navy base and =
the city of North Chicago," Rockingham said in a letter this week to =
U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.). "Regrettably, the Navy does not share in =
that vision and will not commit to the opening of Gate 4. ... The city's =
[Sheridan Crossing] project is in grave risk."
>=20
> Taverns, restaurants, tattoo parlors, jewelry shops and businesses =
catering to sailors howled in protest when the King Drive track crossing =
to Great Lakes was closed and Gate 4 traffic was restricted in 1990. The =
gaudy but thriving Sheridan Road "Strip" across the tracks from Great =
Lakes went into a decline over the next decade.
>=20
> Six years ago, Adm. David Polatty, former base commander, vowed that =
the road would be reopened and suggested Gate 4 -- once a main exit for =
sailors seeking access to the Strip -- would be opened too.
>=20
> "Gate 4 was never conceptually designed to be a main gate," =
Scheuermann said. "It was designed to be an alternate gate. ... It has =
only two lanes."
>=20
> In addition, there is no funding available for more security personnel =
if Gate 4 were  reopened, she said. Private security services are used =
at the base's entrances, she said.
>=20
> "There is no reason to open it," Scheuermann said.
>=20
> Said Kirk: "This is not what the senior Pentagon leadership agreed to. =
We will have to reverse this."
>=20
> The opening of Gate 4 "is critical to North Chicago," Kirk said.
>=20
> "The whole point of $5.5 million in federal money [for gate and =
intersection reconstruction work] was to open that gate and start a flow =
of traffic to the main corridor in North Chicago. We have the new =
African-American veterans memorial there, the new bank, Sheridan =
Crossing. All these projects depend on the gate opening. The key to =
restarting the business climate is commuter traffic."
>=20
> North Chicago will go forward with the Sheridan Crossing project =
whether Gate 4 is open or closed, Rockingham said.

North America unit.

> The Atlanta-based company said it earned $1.26 billion, or 54 cents a =
share, up from $1.11 billion, or 47 cents a share, for the same period a =
year ago. Excluding one-time items, Coca-Cola said it would have earned =
56 cents a share, 3 cents a share higher than estimates. Revenue climbed =
17 percent, to $6.1 billion.
>=20
> Coca-Cola said worldwide unit-case volume grew 6 percent in the =
quarter, the highest growth rate since 2002. International volume was up =
9 percent, offsetting another poor performance for the company in North =
America, where volume declined 3 percent.
>=20
> "What you see today is a very strong quarter, delivered by a company =
and a system that's found its footing," said Chief Executive Neville =
Isdell, who pledged to improve the company's performance in North =
America. "We will win again in our home market, but it will not come =
quickly."
>=20
> Shares of Coca-Cola rose $1.30, to $51.57, on the New York Stock =
Exchange.
>=20
> In other earnings news:
>=20
> *Johnson & Johnson said first-quarter profit fell 22 percent as a big =
charge for an acquisition offset record sales.
>=20
> The New Brunswick, N.J.-based company reported net income of $2.57 =
billion, or 88 cents a share, down from $3.31 billion, or $1.10 a share, =
a year earlier. Excluding a charge of $807 million related to the =
acquisition of Conor Medsystems, Johnson & Johnson said it would have =
earned $1.16 a share. On that basis, analysts were expecting per-share =
earnings of $1.05.
>=20
> Sales gained 16 percent, to $15.04 billion. Sales of prescription =
drugs, the firm's biggest segment, rose nearly 11 percent, to $6.22 =
billion.
>=20
> Shares of Johnson & Johnson gained $1.53, to $64.55, in NYSE trading.
>=20
> *Mellon Financial Corp. posted a 22 percent jump in first- quarter net =
income, as assets topped $1 trillion for the first time.
>=20
> The firm said it earned $252 million, or 60 cents a share, up from =
$207 million, or 50 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest results =
included $8 million in expenses related to the proposed merger with the =
Bank of New York Co., which will create the nation's largest custodian =
of assets, and a $12 million litigation reserve charge.
>=20
> Excluding items, the Pittsburgh-based company said it would have =
earned 58 cents a share, in line with estimates. Revenue rose 13 =
percent, to $1.41 billion. Assets under management surged 28 percent, =
driven by investor deposits of $27 billion.
>=20
> Mellon Financial stock was unchanged at $44.14 in NYSE trading.
>=20
> *State Street Corp. said first-quarter earnings rose 7 percent after =
the company pulled $76 billion into its equity funds and separate =
accounts for investors.
>=20
> The nation's third-largest custodian of investment assets reported net =
income of $314 million, or 93 cents a share, up from $292 million, or 87 =
cents a share, a year ago. The latest results topped estimates by 2 =
cents a share. The Boston-based company said revenue increased 11 =
percent, to $1.7 billion. Assets climbed 20 percent, to $1.85 trillion.

> Full text:
> Consumer advocates have begun criticizing major mortgage lenders, such =
as Countrywide Financial Corp. and GMAC Financial, that also have =
in-house foreclosure businesses.
>=20
> It is "mind-boggling" that in many states people can lose their homes =
in foreclosure without any court hearing and that the foreclosure is =
done by a company with ties to the lender, says Ira Rheingold, general =
counsel for the National Association of Consumer Advocates.
>=20
> "They should be completely objective and not have any financial =
interest in how the case is resolved," Rheingold added.
>=20
> Bert Ely, a banking industry consultant in Alexandria, Va., disagreed, =
saying lenders want to prevent foreclosures. If one must take place, he =
said, lenders want it to proceed quickly and inexpensively.
>=20
> "No legitimate lender wants to foreclose, and the reason why is that =
the losses are very substantial," he said. "Foreclosure is not a =
profitable activity, let me assure you."
>=20
> Foreclosure is so costly to lenders -- on average, they recoup about =
two-thirds of a home's value -- that they should be able to foreclose =
using their own staff rather than having to hire outside attorneys, Ely =
said.
>=20
> "The banks should be allowed to do it the cheapest way possible," Ely =
said.
>=20
> Yet, as interest rates and the foreclosure rate continue to rise, =
federal and state lawmakers and policymakers could be asked to =
scrutinize the vastly different foreclosure processes nationwide.
>=20
> In 30 states consumers can have their case heard by a judge. In the =
other 20 states non-judicial "trustees" generally oversee foreclosures, =
but state laws vary as to who can act as a trustee.
>=20
> In some states the foreclosure company can serve as trustee.
>=20
> Phillip Adleson, corporate counsel for the United Trustees =
Association, a California-based group of independent and in-house =
trustees, said there is no factual data to show that borrowers are worse =
off when a bank handles a foreclosure.
>=20
> "Particularly in states like California, non-judicial foreclosures are =
highly regulated, leaving little discretion to the trustee," Adleson =
said. There is no evidence that banks with in- house trustees are more =
likely to foreclose than independent trustees, he added.
>=20
> "In fact, the last thing most institutional lenders want to do is to =
acquire" foreclosed properties, he said.
>=20
> David Berenbaum, executive vice president of the National Community =
Reinvestment Coalition, a housing advocacy group, said many large =
lenders are trying to reduce costs by getting into parts of the mortgage =
business that have traditionally been run by third parties.

> Full text:
> A Senate committee chairman said Tuesday that Sirius Satellite Radio =
Inc. has "a steep hill to climb" in showing that its proposed purchase =
of XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. will not hurt competition in the =
audio entertainment market.
>=20
> Sirius Chief Executive Mel Karmazin told members of the Senate =
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee that a combined satellite =
radio provider would benefit consumers by letting them access both =
companies' services for a diminished price.
>=20
> Both companies currently have subscription fees of $12.95. Karmazin =
said a merged company would be able to provide both companies' =
programming on one "interoperable" radio for less than the $25.90 it =
would currently cost to subscribe to both services.
>=20
> The combined company would consider offering regulators a guarantee =
that they would not raise prices in order to complete the merger, =
Karmazin said.
>=20
> Sirius' proposed buyout faces significant regulatory hurdles. The =
Federal Communications Commission granted licenses to the two companies =
in 1997 on the condition that they would never merge to create a =
potential satellite radio monopoly.
>=20
> But Karmazin argues that new technology has evolved during the past 10 =
years to provide them with significant competition in the form of =
high-definition radio, online radio and even iPods.
>=20
> "The audio entertainment market is robust, competitive and teaming =
with innovation and will remain so after our merger," Karmazin said.
>=20
> Karmazin received a cool response to this argument from Democratic =
senators, including committee Chairman Daniel Inouye (D- Hawaii).
>=20
> "Given the public interest in promoting competition and maximizing a =
diversity of media outlets, we should be skeptical of claims that new =
technologies necessarily 'change the equation' and provide competition =
sufficient to restrain monopoly power," Inouye said.
>=20
> Karmazin, who previously headed CBS Radio, walked a thin line in his =
testimony between affirming the profitability of satellite radio while =
drawing attention to the financial challenges both providers have faced.
>=20

Sirius and XM reported operating losses last year of $1.1 billion and =
$719 million, respectively.
>=20
> Some lawmakers questioned the rationale for the proposed merger after =
Karmazin said that both companies would still be able to prosper if they =
do not combine forces.
>=20
> "You are saying both companies are in pretty good shape and you =
believe both companies are in position to achieve profitability," said =
Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.). "That is not what provokes a merger."
>=20
> RBC Analyst David Bank agreed that satellite radio will remain a =
viable business without the merger, but he said both companies, and =
their shareholders, would benefit even more from joining forces.

> The chill isn't totally gone from the air, but last week's =
announcement of the Lollapalooza lineup and this week's release of =
Ravinia tickets (online sales begin Thursday) has us ready to move our =
concertgoing to sunnier settings. Here are some of the best acts to =
catch outdoors this summer, whether you're looking to get rowdy or just =
sit back and relax.
>=20
> For tireless rockers
>=20
> If summer breezes fire you up instead of cool you down, head to =
Northerly Island's Charter One Pavilion on June 10 and 11 for mega- =
popular Chicago rockers Fall Out Boy ($35). Keep the adrenaline flowing =
July 28 when Coheed and Cambria, Hawthorne Heights and Bad Religion =
headline the Vans Warped Tour ($13.99-$27.25) at First Midwest Bank =
Amphitheatre. If you need a rest after that all-day music marathon, =
well, we'll understand.
>=20
> For laid-back cats
>=20
> Two words: stress relief. For summer relaxation, you can't beat a spot =
on the lawn for Nickel Creek's Aug. 10 show at Ravinia ($15; pavilion =
seats $45). With their bluegrass rhythms, the folk trio provides tunes =
to get your mind off the 9-to-5. If you need to be soothed sooner, John =
Mayer (above) appears at Charter One Pavilion on June 28 and 29 =
($35.50-$55.50). His latest, Grammy-winning "Continuum" is like a =
massage for your ears.
>=20
> For couch potatoes
>=20
> You resisted at first. But after about 3 billion listens to the =
TV-friendly "How to Save a Life" (featured on "Grey's Anatomy," "Scrubs" =
and "One Tree Hill" and also used in HBO ads) you've accepted that =

First Midwest Bank Amphitheatre June 8 to see pop star and recent =
"American Idol" guest Gwen Stefani ($25- $69.50).
>=20
> For global thinkers
>=20
> So you like quintessential American artists (Bruce Springsteen, yes; =
John Mellencamp, not anymore) but enjoy expanding your palate once in =
awhile? Ravinia's got you covered. Don't miss Brazilian singer-guitarist =
Seu Jorge -- still best known in the U.S. for his role in "The Life =
Aquatic" -- June 17. Return two months later (Aug. 17 and 18) for =
France's Gipsy Kings (above), still making hips move after more than two =
decades. Lawn seats for either show: $15.
>=20
> For advance planners
>=20
> There's no place for procrastination when it comes to hot tickets. =
Hopefully, you already snagged seats for The Police's sold- out shows at =
Wrigley Field (July 5 and 6) and the Crossroads Guitar Festival (July =
28) at Toyota Park, featuring Eric Clapton (above), B.B. King and Sheryl =
Crow. Tickets weren't available long for the guitar extravaganza, and =
both Police shows sold out faster than you can say, "Hey, Sting looks =
pretty good for 55."

> Full text:
> Shares of Northern Trust Corp. hit a 52-week high Tuesday after it =
reported a significantly stronger-than-expected 15 percent jump in =
first-quarter earnings.
>=20
> The Chicago-based bank, which also held its annual shareholders =
meeting, said net income was a record $186.7 million, or 84 cents a =
diluted share, up from $163 million, or 74 cents a share, in the =
year-ago period.
>=20
> The most recent results easily topped the 79-cent-a-share performance =
that analysts had been expecting. Northern noted that it made no =
provision for loan losses in the latest quarter. The year- ago earnings =
included a $4 million set-aside for such losses.
>=20
> Northern specializes in providing private banking services to wealthy =
clients, and it also offers asset-management services to corporate and =
institutional clients.
>=20
> In the first quarter, income from trust, investment and other =
servicing fees rose 10 percent, to $488.9 million, the company said. =
Foreign-exchange trading climbed a hefty 20 percent, to $67.2 million. =
Altogether, non-interest income rose 8 percent, to $613.5 million.
>=20
> Net interest income -- that is, profit from Northern's lending =
activities -- increased 10 percent, to $210.3 million.
>=20
> Northern's latest earnings got some help from a lower income-tax rate. =
While pretax earnings were up 13 percent, the company's income- tax =
payments rose only 9 percent, which contributed to the 15 percent upturn =
in net income.
>=20
> "We are pleased with our performance in the quarter, particularly with =
the accelerated growth in our private client business," said Chairman =
and Chief Executive William Osborn.
>=20
> Despite some serious consolidation in the sector in the last year, =
with Bank of America Corp.'s proposed merger with U.S. Trust Corp., and =
Bank of New York Co.'s pending purchase of Mellon Financial Corp., =
Osborn said Northern's "directors, employees and clients see no reason =
we should become part of another company."
>=20
> "We have a very strong growth record," he said "We plan to say =
independent as long as we can continue to do well for our shareholders."
>=20
> Northern's loss as an independent company would be another blow to =
Chicago's standing in the financial world. Headquartered on LaSalle =
Street, in the heart of the city's financial district, Northern is among =
the last remaining sizable publicly traded financial-services businesses =
based in the Chicago area. Chicago's three biggest banks, for example, =
are owned by out-of-towners.
>=20
> Osborn also was asked if Northern feels any pressure to make a big =
acquisition itself.
>=20
> "Two years ago, we bought the financial-services group of Baring for =
$500 million, and we'll continue to make targeted acquisitions to =
improve our ability to serve our clients," he said.
>=20
> "But we're in a position where we don't have to do things unless it =
makes sense. We're not ones who think that being big for big's sake is =
the right answer."
>=20
> One shareholder asked Osborn why Northern doesn't do a better job =
rewarding investors by hiking its dividend and pointed out that over a =
five-year period Northern's stock has underperformed its peer group.
>=20
> Osborn replied that Northern's stock price rose 17 percent in 2006, =
and he said the company typically returns 60 percent to 65 percent of =
its earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
>=20
> Why doesn't it do more, he was asked.
>=20
> "We're investing in the business," Osborn said, noting that technology =
spending during the next three years will be $1.1 billion to $1.2 =
billion, an increase of $100 million to $150 million over the previous =
three-year period.
>=20
> Northern stock added $1.73, or 2.8 percent, to $64.28, on the Nasdaq =
stock market.
>=20
> In other earnings news:
>=20
> *Packaging Corp. of America said first-quarter net income rose almost =
threefold, to $31.2 million, or 30 cents a share, from $10.9 million, or =
10 cents a share, a year ago.
>=20
> The Lake Forest-based maker of containerboard and corrugated packaging =
said revenue rose 10 percent, to $559.2 million. The report came out =
after the close of trading.

> The dollar reached a dubious milestone Tuesday, as a British pound =
bought more than $2 for the first time in nearly 15 years.
>=20
> That means you'll probably hear more British accents in downtown =
Chicago this summer. Combined with dollar weakness against the euro, =
it's too bad for Chicago's tourism industry that the Olympics won't be =
staged here this year.
>=20
> U.S. investors who hold international mutual funds can count =
themselves among the winners. Stronger foreign currencies buy more =
dollar-based investment returns. The iShares United Kingdom exchange- =
traded fund, for example, is up 7.4 percent this year, compared with a =
4.2 percent gain for the iShares S&P 500 index.
>=20
> Amid uniformly benign financial conditions around the world, traders =
seeking an edge accentuate every difference between investment factors. =
On Tuesday, the spotlight fell on inflation; in particular, on the =
inflation comparison between the United States and Great Britain.
>=20
> Here, the Labor Department reported that so-called core inflation, not =
counting food and energy prices, eased last month from strong showings =
in January and February. On an annual basis, the U.S. consumer price =
index, including food and energy, is climbing at about a 2.8 percent =
rate, well below the 3.4 percent rate of a year ago.
>=20
> Across the pond, the latest British inflation report shows a 3.1 =
percent rate, the steepest inflation there in 10 years. Inflation =
comparisons such as these help convince analysts that the Bank of =
England is more likely to raise interest rates than the U.S. Federal =
Reserve. Higher rates attract traders into a currency.
>=20
> But it is easy to overstate comparisons of routine economic data, =
which can fluctuate day by day. International Monetary Fund statistics =
indicate that inflation is under control in all major countries.
>=20
> Here are a few examples. Inflation in Australia declined to an =
estimated 2.8 percent this year from 4.5 percent in 2000. Inflation in =
Ireland eased to an estimated 2.4 percent this year from 5.2 percent in =
2000. IMF forecasts for 2008 show inflation edging higher in several =
countries, including the United States, but there is no sign of serious =
inflation anywhere among the world's major trading partners.
>=20
> The persistent weakness of the dollar must reflect something else. =
John Brady, senior vice president at Man Financial, said the principal =
difference is economic growth.
>=20
> "We are in a global deflationary environment, and because the U.S. =
imports so much, especially in terms of labor costs, the trend is being =
maintained," he said.
>=20
> Wage inflation is absent in most of the world, he said. On the other =
hand, "the tone and structure of European growth is impressive," he =
said.
>=20
> Brady said petrodollars from the Middle East are being recycled to =
Europe and Britain, not to the U.S.
>=20
> "Some of that may be a political statement; some of it may not be," he =
said. But "that explains the strength of their currencies and helps =
explain the differentials in interest rates."
>=20
> The money supply is booming in Europe, Brady said.
>=20
> "You're seeing a lot more investment going into Europe," he said. "The =
European money supply figures have shown tremendous velocity."

> The sport-utility vehicle carrying Gov. Jon Corzine was traveling =
about 91 m.p.h. moments before it crashed, the superintendent of state =
police said Tuesday.
>=20
> The governor was critically injured when the vehicle crashed into a =
guardrail on the Garden State Parkway just north of Atlantic City last =
week. He apparently was not wearing his seat belt in the front =
passenger's seat.
>=20
> The speed limit along that stretch of the parkway is 65 m.p.h.
>=20
> The SUV, driven by a state trooper, was in the left lane with its =
emergency lights flashing when a pickup tried to get out of its way. =
Instead, it set off a chain reaction that resulted in the crash.
>=20
> Corzine broke his left thigh bone, 11 ribs, collarbone and chest bone. =
He also fractured a vertebra in his lower back.
>=20
> He remained in critical but stable condition Tuesday and doctors were =
assessing when he might be ready to breathe without a ventilator.
>=20
> Doctors have said he doesn't have brain damage or paralysis, and is =
doing well for someone with so many injuries.
>=20
> The driver, Trooper Robert Rasinski, could be charged if investigators =
determine the crash was preventable, said Col. Rick Fuentes, =
superintendent of state police.
>=20
> Rasinski and an aide to the governor were not seriously hurt.
>=20
> There is no timetable for when Corzine may be able to resume governing =
the state. Senate President Richard Codey is acting governor.
>=20
> Once Corzine is breathing unassisted, he should be able to speak. That =
would make it possible for physical therapists to do more to help him =
regain use of his leg, a process expected to take up to six months. =
Corzine, 60, a former investment banker, gave up his seat in the U.S. =
Senate to become governor in 2006.

quarterly reports.
>=20
> The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks closed down 2.48, at =
828.96, after hitting an all-time high early in Tuesday's trading =
session.
>=20
> Consumer prices eased in March, compared with January and February =
data.
>=20
> Housing starts increased in March, thanks to a rebound in home =
construction in the Midwest. Housing stocks posted gains, led by KB Home =
and D.R. Horton.
>=20
> Among the companies posting upbeat quarterly results were Coca- Cola =
and Johnson & Johnson. The two blue-chip companies were the biggest =
contributors to the Dow's gain.
>=20

Losers held a slight edge over winners among NYSE-listed stocks.
>=20

an unexpected increase in British inflation prompted traders to assume =

> Full text:
> The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday limited the power of states to =
oversee financial institutions, ruling that Michigan can't regulate the =
mortgage-lending subsidiaries of Wachovia Corp. and other federally =
chartered banks.
>=20
> The justices, in a 5-3 vote, said banks regulated by the U.S. Office =
of the Comptroller of the Currency have a broad shield from additional =
state scrutiny. The decision comes amid calls for tighter regulation of =
the mortgage business because of the subprime lending crisis.
>=20
> The ruling spares so-called national banks, including Wachovia, =
National City Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co., from what they said would be =
a patchwork of rules around the country. Michigan laws require mortgage =
lenders to register with the state, pay annual fees, submit financial =
statements and keep records for examination purposes. At least six =
states, including California and Florida, have similar regulations.
>=20
> "Federal control shields national banking from unduly burdensome and =
duplicative state regulation," Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the =
majority.
>=20
> The case centered on the U.S. National Bank Act, which pre-empts =
states from regulating the activities of national banks. The main =
question was whether that principle applies when banks take advantage of =
the other legal protections they get by setting up subsidiaries. An OCC =
regulation, backed by the court, says subsidiaries are shielded from =
state oversight just as their parent companies are.
>=20
> Justices Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, Stephen Breyer and Samuel =
Alito joined Ginsburg's opinion. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices =
John Paul Stevens and Antonin Scalia dissented. Justice Clarence Thomas =
didn't take part in the case.
>=20
> "The federal interest in protecting depositors in national banks from =
their subsidiaries' liabilities surely does not justify a grant of =
immunity from laws that apply to competitors," Stevens wrote. He said =
the OCC rule could "drive companies seeking refuge from state regulation =
into the arms of federal parents."
>=20
> Banking industry representatives applauded the ruling, as did the Bush =
administration.
>=20
> "Avoiding a patchwork of duplicative and conflicting federal and state =
regulation makes it easier for national banks to grant credit to =
customers across state lines," said Edward Yingling, president of the =
American Bankers Association.
>=20
> Consumer advocates had argued that states are better equipped to =
protect their consumers against predatory lending and other potential =
abuses because they are more familiar with and accountable to their =
constituencies.
>=20
> The case began in 2003, when Wachovia Mortgage became an operating =
subsidiary of Wachovia Bank. After the mortgage lender said it would =

0.1 percent last month. The Commerce Department reported that housing =
starts increased 0.8 percent, led by a 45 percent jump in the Midwest, =
and the Federal Reserve said factory output jumped 0.7 percent, though =
overall industrial production fell as warm weather reduced electricity =
demand.
>=20
> The inflation figures mean Federal Reserve policymakers might keep =
interest rates unchanged when they meet again next month.
>=20
> "This is a big relief for the Fed," said Nigel Gault, chief U.S. =
economist at Global Insight Inc. in Lexington, Mass. "It's one good =
month, and the Fed is going to have to see more good numbers before it =
can relax, but it comes after a few months where inflation was rising."
>=20
> Including food and energy, consumer prices rose 0.6 percent in March. =
Core prices were up 2.5 percent in the 12 months ended in March, the =
smallest year-over-year gain in almost a year. Overall, prices were up =
2.8 percent from the same time last year.
>=20
> "It'll take some time to establish the reality that core inflation =
isn't accelerating," said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura =
Securities International Inc. in New York. "The Fed is not going to let =
down their guard yet. By the end of the year, we'll see numbers that =
give us confidence."
>=20
> Tuesday's report showed energy prices jumped 5.9 percent, the most =
since September 2005, led by an 11 percent surge in gasoline prices. =
Food prices, which account for about a fifth of the price index, =
increased 0.3 percent. Rising demand for grain-based biofuels such as =
ethanol, which is distilled mostly from corn in the U.S., helped drive =
up food prices, economists said.
>=20
> Housing costs, which include some energy costs and account for =
one-third of the total index, rose 0.2 percent. The cost of hotel stays =
dropped 2.3 percent, the biggest decline since September 2005. Medical =
care edged up 0.1 percent, the smallest gain since August 2005. Clothing =
prices fell 1 percent, the most since April 2001.
>=20
> The Commerce Department said builders broke ground on new homes at an =
annual rate of 1.518 million last month. Starts fell in the three other =
regions besides the Midwest. Economists had expected starts to fall to a =
1.495 million pace in March.
>=20
> "=46rom here on, demand should continue to move upwards, albeit =
gradually, and building activity should follow," said Guy Verberne, head =
of international economics at Fortis Bank Nederland NV in Amsterdam.
>=20
> Building permits, a sign of future construction, also rose 0.8 =
percent. Permits for single-family homes increased 1.4 percent. =
Construction of single-family homes rose 2 percent, but work on =
multifamily structures fell 4 percent.
>=20
> In the third report, the Fed said industrial production declined 0.2 =
percent in March. Mining output, which includes oil drilling, rose 0.1 =
percent, but utility production dropped 7 percent.
>=20
> "Almost all the weakness was in utilities," said Kevin Logan, senior =
market economist at Dresdner Kleinwort in New York. For factories, =
"we're getting back to a higher level, which is positive certainly for =
the manufacturing sector. So, it's slightly encouraging in =
manufacturing."
>=20
> Manufacturing production increased on higher orders for business =
equipment such as computers. Factories are picking up the pace of =
production after working off bloated inventories. That could boost =
business investment and provide support for a Fed forecast of an =
economic rebound.

> Full text:
> As the song suggests, there's no place like April in Paris. If you =
can't make the transatlantic flight this spring, consider April in =
Chicago, with a French twist. Turns out the city has a plethora of =
Parisian-style stores to browse. And Mayor Daley's fondness for =
French-style wrought iron fences and street lamps, which dot the =
cityscape, makes it even easier to picture yourself in the City of =
Light.
>=20
> "The romance of Paris in springtime is something to dream about," says =
Susan Jablonski, owner of The Left Bank (1155 W. Webster Ave., =
773-929-7422) a jewelry boutique in Chicago. "I've been a Francophile my =
entire life."
>=20
> Inspired by one of the famous attractions in Paris, The Left Bank has =
a serious Francophile motto: "The Soul of Paris in Chicago." The shop =
sells jewelry, antiques and gifts, as well as bridal accessories.
>=20
> Jablonski is one of many Chicago store owners who has imported French =
products and channeled the famed city's style.
>=20
> "I've always admired French women -- how chic they are. They have an =
effortless way about them," says Kelly Bry, owner of Ouest (1063 W. =
Madison St., 312-421-2799) in the West Loop. The store's motto: =
"Inspired by the timeless elegance of the French woman." Ouest, which =
means "west" in French, carries French designers such as Sonia Rykiel =
and Barbara Bui.
>=20
> If anyone would know where to find French style in the city, it would =
be Marie Vavassori, trade attache at the French Trade Office in =
Chicago."Shopping in France is about finding the little boutique that =
will have the item that no one else will have -- the unique thing that =
everyone around you will envy you for," she says.
>=20
> Espace (1205 N. Milwaukee Ave., 773-252-6994) in Wicker Park, is one =
of her favorites. She also recommends Porte Rouge (1911 W. Division St., =
773-269-2800) for French cooking supplies, Hejfina (1529 N. Milwaukee =
Ave., 773-772-0002) for new designers and G Boutique (2131 N. Damen =
Ave., 773-235-1234), which carries Aubade, a French lingerie brand.
>=20
> Of course, Chicago has its share of internationally known French- =
owned stores, mostly clustered along or near Michigan Avenue. Such =
famous names include the Chanel boutique (935 N. Michigan Ave., 312- =
787-5500), Hermes of Paris (110 E. Oak St., 312-787-8175), Louis Vuitton =
(919 N. Michigan Ave., 312-944-2010), L'Occitane en Provence (900 N. =
Michigan Ave., 312-202-0906), Lacoste (835 N. Michigan Ave. at Water =
Tower Place, 312-951-1300) and Anne Fontaine boutique (909 N. Michigan =
Ave., 312-943-0401).
>=20
> The Magnificent Mile has beaucoup French flair, but so do other =
Chicago neighborhoods.
>=20
> You can't visit Paris without experiencing a French flea market. =
P.O.S.H. (613 N. State St., 312-280-1602), in the historic Tree Studios, =
offers the next best thing. Here you can find new and vintage home =
accessories from Europe and pick up a few French "souvenirs," such as =
charming Paris guidebooks or antique kitchen canisters.
>=20
> Fabrice (1714 N. Wells St., 312-280-0011), in Old Town, models itself =
after a Paris boutique and offers the famed Fabrice jewelry collection, =
known for its mix of feminine and bold pieces. Fabrice also offers =
handbags, wraps and bath and body products.
>=20
> Cotelac (1159 W. Webster Ave., 773-281-2330), a French-owned fashion =
house, established its first location outside of Europe in Lincoln Park. =
Cotelac is known for its fabric treatment (crinkled or pleated) and =
wash-and-wear style.
>=20
> Whether you shop along the Magnificent Mile or in neighborhood =
boutiques, you will have one advantage over Parisians when it comes to =
splurging, Vavassori says.
>=20
> "In France, because things are more expensive and harder to return, =
you think twice," she says. "Also, there are sales here all year long. =
In France, you get summer and winter sales, that's all. So I'd say that =
one probably buys twice as much here than in France!"

> European stocks on Monday rose the most this month after banks said =
they might compete to buy ABN Amro Holding NV, and Royal Philips =
Electronics NV reported profit that beat estimates. ABN Amro, the =
largest Dutch bank and the parent of Chicago's LaSalle Bank, jumped to a =
record high.
>=20
> "There's no sign of mergers and acquisitions stopping," said Lucy =
MacDonald, chief investment officer of global equities at RCM in London. =
"Corporate profit is still high. The stock market is rewarding =
acquirers. It all looks set to continue."
>=20
> The Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index added 1.2 percent. The Stoxx 50 rose 1.3 =
percent, and the Euro Stoxx 50, a measure for the nations sharing the =
euro, gained 1.4 percent. National benchmarks advanced in all 18 Western =
European markets.
>=20
> ASIAN STOCKS ADVANCE: Asian stocks rose to a seven-week high, led by =
Canon Inc. and Honda Motor Co. after a decline in the yen boosted the =
value of their exports.
>=20
> The Morgan Stanley Capital International Asia-Pacific index added 1.2 =
percent. Japan's Nikkei index climbed 1.5 percent, while the broader =
Topix index advanced 1.2 percent. Markets gained elsewhere in the =
region, except in Taiwan and Thailand, with benchmarks in Australia and =
China closing at records.

> Full text:
> Chief executives of the biggest Wall Street firms urged President =
George W. Bush to seek greater access to overseas markets for U.S. =
financial services, adding to pressure that manufacturers and farmers =
are applying on the White House.
>=20
> The Financial Services Forum, a lobbying group of banks, securities =
firms and insurance companies, warned Bush in a letter Monday that "the =
continued growth and vitality" of their businesses hinges on the =
administration's ability to negotiate trade agreements that lower =
barriers to investment.
>=20
> "We respectfully urge the administration to make the expansion of =
market access for financial services firms a first-tier priority in all =
trade negotiations -- both bilateral and multinational efforts - - =
especially the Doha round," the Washington-based group said in the =
letter.
>=20
> The request is signed by the forum's 20 members, including Citigroup =
Inc. CEO Charles Prince, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO Lloyd Blankfein, =
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. CEO Richard Fuld, Merrill Lynch & Co. CEO =
Stanley O'Neal and Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack.
>=20
> The Doha round of World Trade Organization talks is named after the =
city in Qatar where the talks began in 2001. Negotiations resumed in =
January, after breaking down in July because the U.S. resisted cutting =
farm subsidies more unless India, the European Union and Japan agreed to =
steep cuts in their agriculture duties.
>=20
> The forum's letter said that the U.S. financial services industry is =
eight times larger than American farm output and two-thirds as large as =
manufacturing.
>=20
> "We understand that the administration and Congress must take into =
account the interests and objectives of all sectors of the U.S. =
economy," the letter stated. "We are concerned, however, that the =
financial services sector is not receiving the attention it deserves =
based on its contribution to the national economy."
>=20
> U.S. financial institutions "continue to encounter significant =
obstacles abroad," such as foreign ownership limits, licensing quotas =
and excessive regulation, the group said. The obstacles can be =
"effectively addressed" at the WTO, the group said, declining to name =
China's strict controls on foreign capital.
>=20
> The letter was sent to the White House less than a week after the U.S. =
filed two WTO complaints against China aimed at stopping what the Bush =
administration claims is rampant piracy of copyrighted movies, music, =
software and books.
>=20
> WTO negotiators from Australia, Japan, the U.S., the European Union, =
India and Brazil said last week in New Delhi that talks to conclude the =
Doha round are in a "new phase." They pledged to meet again next month =
in an effort to conclude an accord this year.
>=20
> Finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrial countries said at =
a meeting April 13 that concluding the Doha talks was "imperative" and =
they pledged more aid for poorer countries as an incentive to complete =
negotiations.
>=20
> The World Bank predicts that a successful conclusion of the Doha round =
would boost the world economy by $96 billion.

> Full text:
> 'Left, left, lefty-right, left," the sergeant shouts. "I eat my =
breakfast too darn soon. Hungry as a hound dog. By noon." And then an =
echo of troops hollers back in the misty morning fog. And they're =
getting louder.
>=20
> Outdoor military-style boot camp fitness programs are gaining muscle =
and recruiting more. And in some cases, boot camp itself is being =
drafted by gym members who are demanding that their club install one of =
these rigorous programs. Within the last eight years alone, dozens of =
independent outdoor boot camps have launched in the Chicago area, not =
including the major fitness chains that have added like programs to =
their curriculums, such as Lifestyle Fitness, East Bank Club, Equinox =
and Xsport Fitness.
>=20
> So why are these programs becoming so popular? Just like diets, =
exercise regimens change and promote new angles on a similar theme. In =
the early 1980s, aerobics classes with high-impact cardiovascular =
training were all the rage. Then walking made a comeback. Then yoga. Now =
most fitness programs and independent trainers promote cardiovascular =
exercise paired with strength training.
>=20
> "Boot camp fitness programs have become so popular because they =
incorporate strength and cardio training into an hour workout, saving =
you time by getting your heart rate up while working your muscles," said =
Andrea Metcalf, owner of MBC Fitness (mind-body- connection), 28 North =
Cass Ave., Westmont (630-493-3000), and a member of the NBC 5 Fitness =
Team. Boot camps also offer a good deal. In many ways, it's like having =
the attention of a personal trainer but at group rates.
>=20
> "I started my Bulldog Bootcamp because I really loved helping people =
get in shape but, like them, found the health club setting increasingly =
boring," said Greg Major, owner of Bulldog Bootcamp (866-966-3966, =
bulldogbootcamp.com). "I started meeting my clients outside to workout, =
creating a gym without walls, and there we tackled big fitness =
challenges that can rarely be achieved in a gym setting."
>=20
> Boot camp programs, for the most part, share a common outdoor hourly =
itinerary and a strict, yet encouraging fitness sergeant to push you =
through an often rigorous routine. First, there's a warm- up to make =
sure the major muscles get stretched, followed by cardio in the form of =
jogging, sprinting, relays or circuit work. Strength training is thrown =
in with push-ups, sit-ups, lunges, crunches, squats and numerous =
variations.
>=20
> Camp usually is Monday through Friday, and each program promises =
something different each day. Trainers may alternate heavy cardio and =
light strength training one day, followed by a session of heavy strength =
training and very little cardio. When joining, you are asked to run =
through an assessment in which your progress will be compared with your =
four-week assessment test.
>=20
> Results more than physical
>=20
> Most boot campers report good results. In Metcalf's Naked Boot Camp, =
campers were weighed before and after an eight-week program and showed =
an average weight loss of 13 pounds and average body fat drop of 5 =
percent. But the positive results are more than physical.
>=20
> "We all cheer each other on, and in turn, we build relationships and a =
sense of camaraderie," said Renee Davis of Oak Park, who tried Chicago =
Boot Camp for Women (773-577-7538, bootcampchicago.com). "When I started =
the camp, I couldn't jog a half block, and now I can jog a mile without =
the slightest problem. It's that sense of accomplishment, too, that has =
given me an amazing amount of confidence in all areas of my life."
>=20
> Davis said this sense of confidence has carried over in her work and =
family life, making every aspect of her life easier thanks to the energy =
and feelings of self-accomplishment she gains from waking up each =
weekday to attend boot camp.
>=20
> A boot camp for everyone
>=20
> While most boot camps share a similar exercise model, each one is =
different. Some programs are tailored for brides, new mothers, for men =
and women, women only, for marathon or sports training, with spiritual =
aspects or for varying fitness levels.
>=20
> In fact, Mike George of Mike George Fitness System (312-943- 6700, =
mg-fitness.com) is taking the military style of fitness to a different =
level; he even offers free admission for up to 10 active military =
reservists. Refusing to call it a boot camp program, he terms the =
program "Fit to Fight," and it helps everyone enrolled become perfectly =
fit to deal with anything from the daily grind to sudden monumental =
catastrophes to responding to accidents to defending yourself in an =
attack.
>=20
> "After 9/11, the face of our battlefield changed at home, with many =
citizens enrolling in the Army and with most of us becoming aware and =
protective of our surroundings," George said. "But now, we've become =
complacent, and in reality, Americans are fat and out of shape. Very few =
of us are able to defend ourselves."
>=20
> George's program is a five-day-a-week class, 5:30 to 6:30 a.m. Tuesday =
through Saturday at North Avenue Beach. Like boot camps, each day is =
different, but he adds CPR skills, weighted body bars for gun and knife =
handling, 120-pound water bags to simulate lifesaving techniques as well =
as karate, judo, boxing and aikido fundamentals.
>=20
> Before joining any program, ask the fitness director if there are any =
physical requirements, and when in doubt see your doctor for guidance =
regarding any rigorous physical activity. Programs range from $90 to =
$400 for a four-week session. If you already belong to a gym, ask about =
special boot camp sessions that may already be included in your =
membership.

down from $98.8 billion in January, the Treasury Department said Monday. =
Including short-term securities such as Treasury bills and non-market =

from $79.6 billion the month before.
>=20

$12.3 billion the previous month.

MacLeod, a Chicago native, served the city well, as chairman of the =
Board of Trustees of the YWCA of Chicago during the fundraising and =
building of the Harriet Harris YWCA on Chicago's South Side. Once, when =
calling on a potential donor, he was told that the company had already =
given to the YMCA. "Then it's time for the girls," he said with his =
characteristic directness, and left with a similar donation for the =
girls. Mr. MacLeod was also a member of the board of directors of the =
Isham YMCA. He moved to Highland Park from Winnetka in the early 1970s =
and eventually served two terms on the Highland Park City Council from =
1983 to 1991. In his later years, he became a generous supporter of the =
Highland Park Community Foundation. In March, 2006, he received the =
organization's first Distinguished Citizen Award for his strong support =
in establishing the foundation, which uses interest from an endowment =
for grants to support community organizations. He also supported arts =
and cultural organizations throughout the Chicago land area. Born on =
Chicago's south side on Jan. 24, 1917, he was a great randson of Norman =
Wait Harris, the founder of the Harris Bank. Mr. MacLeod spent his youth =
in southern California and was the first of three generations to =
graduate from Pomona College. He also served as a trustee of the =
college. During World War II, Mr. MacLeod served in the U.S. Navy Supply =
Corps. Following the war, he was discharged as a Lieutenant Commander. =
Mr. MacLeod is survived by his wife Martha; sons Craig and Andrew; =
daughters Jessi Ruth MacLeod and Martha Flanders; step- children Price =
Patton, Ann Patton and Sarah Duncan; 18 grandchildren and one =
great-grandchild. A memorial service will be held at 3 p.m. Saturday at =
Trinity Episcopal Church, 425 Laurel Ave., Highland Park. In lieu of =
flowers, the family ask that donations be made in Mr. MacLeod's memory =
to the Highland Park Community Foundation.

> Full text:
> When Chicago native Norman Bobins announced in January that he was =
retiring as head of ABN Amro's North American operations, area banking =
observers were anxious to see whether the Amsterdam-based financial =
institution would name a Dutch replacement.
>=20
> Doing so, they figured, would signal that ABN wanted to keep a closer =
eye on its LaSalle unit, Chicago's second-biggest bank, after JPMorgan =
Chase & Co., with deposit market share of 14.1 percent.
>=20
> On Monday, ABN picked Chicagoan Robert Moore, chief financial officer =
of LaSalle and ABN Amro North America, to become head of its North =
American unit effective May 1.
>=20
> But the promotion of the Lake Bluff resident and graduate of =
Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management could be a hollow =
victory for Chicago civic boosters because ABN faces an uncertain =
future.
>=20
> Last month, ABN entered exclusive takeover talks with British bank =
Barclays PLC, and Friday it acknowledged that a consortium of three =
other banks, including Charter One parent Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, =
also has invited it into "exploratory talks" about a deal.
>=20
> Depending on who buys ABN, its Chicago-area operations could undergo a =
restructuring. For example, because of its area presence with Charter =
One, RBS could find itself with duplicate positions that would have to =
be cut if it winds up with the winning bid. A Barclays deal, on the =
other hand, could mean less upheaval for LaSalle workers because =
Barclays isn't a major U.S. retail banking force.
>=20
> RBS, whose Charter One has Chicago-area deposit market share of 2.8 =
percent, said last week that it might offer to buy ABN with Banco =
Santander Central Hispano SA and Fortis.
>=20
> Moore, 45, also will assume the title of senior executive vice =
president for ABN Amro globally. He rejoined ABN as CFO for North =
American operations, including LaSalle, in September 2006, after working =
for the Dutch bank in North America from 1996 to 2001. Before rejoining =
the company, he spent six years at Diageo PLC in London.
>=20
> "The board decided to make this appointment at this time because our =
strategy for North America remains clear: We must build upon our legacy =
of success while striving for continuous performance improvement," Joost =
Kuiper, ABN Amro board member responsible for North America, said in a =
statement.
>=20
> In January, Bobins said he would retire at year's end. At that time, =
it was announced that his role would be divided into two jobs. Moore =
assumes the CEO post responsible for all ABN activities in North =
America, including holding company LaSalle Bank Corp. Larry Richman =
earlier was named CEO of LaSalle Bank and will report to Moore.
>=20
> As previously announced, Bobins will assume the position of LaSalle =
Bank Corp. chairman May 1.
>=20
> Separately, ABN said Monday that first-quarter net income rose to 71 =
cents a share from 53 cents a share a year earlier, helped by the sale =
of a mortgage business and higher income in Europe.

> How many past presidents of the World Bank have been household names? =
How many have become the subject of front-page controversies? None that =
come to mind. That's not because they were all stellar performers, or =
because the bank has done an exceptional job of curing poverty.
>=20
> Then there is Paul Wolfowitz. The frenzy over his performance suggests =
it's far more dangerous to be bold and innovative in carrying out the =
World Bank's mission than to stick to the way things have always been =
done.
>=20
> Wolfowitz is currently being assailed because of his handling of a =
conflict of interest involving a longtime girlfriend, Shaha Raza, who =
worked at the institution.
>=20
> It's a classic manufactured scandal, in which minor suspicions are =
pumped out of proportion, giving critics the chance to say the person in =
question must leave because he can no longer function effectively. If =
Wolfowitz is driven out over charges such as these, it will be a message =
to able, strong-minded people that they should shun public service at =
all costs.
>=20
> The accusation against Wolfowitz is that he arranged a cushy deal for =
Raza, including a promotion and a big pay raise in her new job at the =
State Department.
>=20
> But it's clear he tried to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. =
He offered to recuse himself from matters involving her, but the ethics =
committee said that wouldn't suffice. It was agreed she would leave for =
the State Department, and the committee recommended compensation for the =
damage to her career.
>=20
> It then ordered Wolfowitz to see that its decision was implemented, =
which left him in the position of having to dictate the terms of her =
departure, including the salary increase. An outside law firm hired to =
conduct an independent review of the agreement concluded it was "a =
reasonable resolution" that would avoid the risk of "protracted legal =
proceedings."
>=20
> Wolfowitz apologized last week for his role in the episode. But no =
matter how carefully he conducted himself, it's clear he had plenty of =
enemies inside and outside the bank eager to seize any excuse to =
undermine him.
>=20
> As one of the architects of the Iraq war, his appointment didn't go =
over well in Europe and other places where the war is highly unpopular. =
And his decision to make a priority of fighting the pervasive corruption =
at the World Bank provoked antagonism among veteran staffers who were =
accustomed to a certain amount of graft among recipient governments.
>=20
> An example: After Republic of Congo President Denis Sassou- Nguesso =
racked up hundreds of thousands of dollars in hotel bills on a visit to =
New York, Wolfowitz decided to oppose debt relief for his government.
>=20
> That stand won plaudits from reformers in Congo, but not from some =
European governments, including the French. They argued, as National =
Public Radio put it, that "the World Bank needed to remain engaged in =
poor countries such as Congo, regardless of how corrupt their =
governments may be."
>=20
> Should the World Bank treat corruption as a debilitating virus that =
retards development in poor countries? That's an excellent topic for =
analysis and debate, which Wolfowitz tried to kick-start.
>=20
> Too bad his critics would rather talk about matters that have far less =
to do with the fate of the world's poor.

> A group of investors on Monday announced plans to buy Sallie Mae, =
taking the nation's largest student lender private in a $25 billion deal =
that comes as some regulators call for tougher standards and lower =
federal subsidies for the $85 billion college loan industry.
>=20
> Private-equity firm J.C. Flowers & Co. and three other investors will =
pay $60 a share for Reston, Va.-based SLM Corp., commonly referred to as =
Sallie Mae. The sale price represents a nearly 50 percent premium for =
Sallie Mae's previously sagging stock before takeover rumors emerged =
late last week.
>=20
> Shares of Sallie Mae surged $8.29, or 17.7 percent, to $55.05, Monday =
on the New York Stock Exchange.
>=20
> J.C. Flowers and private-equity firm Friedman Fleischer & Lowe will =
invest $4.4 billion and own 50.2 percent of the company. Bank of America =
Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. each will invest $2.2 billion and each =
will own 24.9 percent. The buyers also will provide Sallie Mae with $200 =
billion in backup financing.
>=20
> John Oros, a managing director at J.C. Flowers, said the firm was =
drawn by Sallie Mae's stock price, which had fallen to about $40 a share =
before takeover talks began. The investors also weren't deterred by the =
brewing troubles for lenders and the prospect of a clampdown on the =
industry by lawmakers.
>=20
> "We think Sallie Mae is a great company and a great business, and =
appropriate regulation will sort itself out in a way that will make this =
an attractive transaction for us," Oros said.
>=20
> Sallie Mae is by far the largest school lender, originating $23.4 =
billion in student loans last year, many of them federally subsidized, =
such as widely used Stafford loans.
>=20
> But it has also been subject to greater attention from lawmakers and =
regulators currently probing ties between lenders and college officials =
who guide students toward specific lenders for their loans.
>=20
> Company spokesman Tom Joyce said that even though the company will be =
private, it will still be subject to federal and state lending laws. =
Student borrowers and institutions will see no change in the way loans =
are handled or processed, he said.

> Citigroup Inc., the nation's biggest bank, said Monday that first- =
quarter earnings dropped 11 percent because of expenses to slash 17,000 =
jobs, but it still beat estimates and it reported the fastest growth in =
revenue in almost three years.

> The New York-based bank posted net income of $5.01 billion, or $1.01 a =
share, down from $5.64 billion, or $1.12 a share. It was the third =
straight quarter that net income declined. Excluding a $871 million =
charge, Citigroup would have earned $1.18 a share, beating estimates by =
9 cents a share.
>=20
> Revenue rose 15 percent, to $25.5 billion, while expenses increased to =
$14 billion from $12.7 billion. It was the first time revenue grew =
faster than operating costs since the third quarter of 2005, led by a 36 =
percent surge in profit from investment banking and trading.
>=20
> "Revenues up 15 percent, expenses up only about 10 percent, if you =
adjust them for the restructuring charge," said Chris Hagedorn, a =
portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cincinnati. "That's =
a piece of news that investors will key on."
>=20
> Citigroup stock added $1.33, to $52.93, on the New York Stock =
Exchange.
>=20
> In other earnings news:
>=20
> *W.W. Grainger Inc., in what it called "a strong start to the year," =
reported a stronger-than-expected 18 percent increase in first-quarter =
earnings.
>=20
> The Lake Forest-based distributor of facilities-maintenance products =
said net income was $101.8 million, or $1.17 a diluted share, up from =
the year-ago period's $86.2 million, or 93 cents a share. Sales rose 9 =
percent, to $1.55 billion. Analysts had expected Grainger's per-share =
earnings to be $1.09.
>=20
> Revenue benefited from strong sales of products related to the =
unseasonably cold weather in March. However, it noted a sales drag "as =
the company continues to unwind low margin contracts for automotive and =
integrated-supply customers."
>=20
> The latest quarter benefited from a $1.3 million gain from the sale of =
certain assets. Per-share results reflect a decline in Grainger shares =
outstanding to 84 million from 89.6 million a year ago.
>=20
> Shares of Grainger increased $2.06, to $81.59, on the NYSE.
>=20
> *Wachovia Corp. said first-quarter earnings climbed 33 percent, helped =
by growth in lending income and the acquisition of Golden West Financial =
Corp.
>=20
> The Charlotte-based bank said net income jumped to $2.3 billion, or =
$1.20 a share, from $1.73 billion, or $1.09 a share, a year ago. =
Excluding merger and restructuring charges, the nation's fourth- largest =
bank would have earned $1.20 a share. On that basis, Wall Street =
expected earnings of $1.16 a share. Revenue grew 17 percent, to $8.24 =
billion.

preparers and accountants are advising more diligence on the part of =
their clients.

>=20
> IRS Commissioner Mark Everson stated it plainly: "If you earn more =
than $100,000 or you're a millionaire, you're a lot more likely to be =
audited these days than a few years ago."
>=20
> Errors have fueled much of this sort of investigation, especially as =
the IRS has improved its technology to match the income reported from =
employers, banks and other institutions to the individual tax return, =
said Bart L. Fooden, a certified public accountant at Bart L. Fooden & =
Associates in Woodbury, N.Y.
>=20
> "With the technological advances and with all the reporting done =
through the banks to the IRS, it's been easy to match it up and catch =
errors of omission," he said.
>=20
> Alan Dlugash, a partner at Marks Paneth & Shron in Manhattan, advises =
clients to bring in every document reporting such items as interest from =
dividends, Social Security or a pension, no matter how small, instead of =
estimating amounts.
>=20
> Retirement benefits cuts outpace savings
>=20
> Workers facing shrinking retirement benefits aren't saving enough to =
make up for what they will lose, according to a new study.
>=20
> Seventeen percent of workers said their employers had cut retirement =
benefits in the last two years, according to the Employee Benefit =
Research Institute's annual retirement confidence survey, released last =
week. But among workers whose expected benefits have been cut, nearly =
two in five said they have done nothing in response.
>=20
> The vast majority of employees are likely to need additional savings =
if they hope to retire with the benefits they expected before the shift =
away from company-sponsored traditional pensions to 401(k) plans, said =
Jack VanDerhei, the study's co-author.
>=20
> Set ground rules when working with spouse
>=20
> Keeping peace on the home front and at work can be a challenge for =
husband-and-wife business teams. Here are tips from experts:
>=20
> *Define your work roles. Big decisions, such as whether to lease space =
or stay in a home office, probably should be made together. But for =
daily operational questions, define your areas of expertise and don't =
second-guess each other.
>=20
> *Set work/home boundaries. That might mean turning off the ringer on =
your business phone after 6 p.m. or making Sundays an inviolable family =
day. "We have always had a rule of not talking business in bed," said =
Sarah Edwards, co-author with her husband, Paul, of "The Best Home =
Businesses for the 21st Century."
>=20
> *Think twice before putting all your financial eggs in one basket. =
You'll sleep easier if one of you keeps his or her day job until you =
know whether this business can support you.

> Full text:
> Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who steadfastly has resisted =
full-fledged peace talks with the Palestinians, held a wide-ranging =
discussion with their leader Sunday on relations between Israel and a =
future Palestinian state.
>=20
> Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas were accompanied by =
aides for the first half of the two-hour meeting and then talked one on =
one. They issued no statements afterward, leaving the aides to give =
somewhat differing accounts.
>=20
> Saeb Erekat, an aide to Abbas, called the meeting a breakthrough, the =
first time since the collapse of peace talks in 2001 that the two sides =
had discussed a scenario for Palestinian independence in the West Bank =
and Gaza Strip.
>=20
> "We started today to talk about a political horizon" beyond the =
conflict, Erekat said. "It was a good beginning."
>=20
> However, Israeli officials said Olmert avoided "final status" issues =
at the heart of the conflict, including the borders of a future =
Palestinian state, a possible division of Jerusalem and the fate of =
Palestinian refugees wanting to return to homes in Israel.
>=20
> The luncheon meeting at Olmert's official residence was arranged under =
prodding by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is struggling =
to revive peace efforts. The two men, who had held three previous =
encounters since December, agreed recently at Rice's insistence to meet =
every two weeks.
>=20
> Olmert has refused to address final status issues unless the =
Palestinian Authority government, a coalition of Abbas' Fatah movement =
and the Hamas movement that refuses to make peace with Israel, =
explicitly recognizes the Jewish state and forswears violence.
>=20
> Meanwhile, the Israelis say, any talks about a peace settlement are =
hypothetical.
>=20
> "They did not speak about final status issues," David Baker, an Olmert =
spokesman, said after Sunday's meeting. "They did speak about a =
political horizon, which included economic cooperation with a future =
Palestinian state and expanding the dialogue about economic ventures =
with Palestinians and how a future Palestinian economy would be =
comprised in such a state."
>=20
> But Erekat, at a news conference in the West Bank city of Ramallah, =
said the two leaders touched indirectly on key political issues while =
discussing a recently revived Saudi peace initiative. He predicted a =
more substantive discussion in the coming weeks.
>=20
> "Not all issues can be resolved in one, two or three meetings," Erekat =
said. "But I can say that we have started to talk."
>=20
> An aide said Olmert insisted that Abbas "put all his weight, all his =
influence" to win the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who was =
captured by Palestinian militants, including some from Hamas, nearly 10 =
months ago along the Gaza border.
>=20
> The leaders discussed but reported no response to the captors' =
demands, passed recently to Israel through Egyptian mediators and Abbas' =
government, to free 1,400 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.
>=20
> In Gaza, meanwhile, a previously unknown Palestinian group said Sunday =
it had killed a British journalist kidnapped March 12 in Gaza City, but =
the claim could not be confirmed.
>=20
> "The brigades of Tawheed and Jihad" said it killed correspondent Alan =
Johnston, 44, of the British Broadcasting Corp. to call attention to the =
imprisonment of thousands of Palestinians in Israel. The Palestinian =
government and the BBC said there was no evidence to back up the claim.

> Full text:
> Sen. Barack Obama raised more money from donors for his presidential =
primary campaign than any other candidate during the first three months =
of the year, but Democratic front-runner Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton =
maintained a financial advantage by transferring money left from her =
Senate re-election campaign last year.
>=20
> Obama raised $24.8 million for the primary, compared with Clinton's =
$19.1 million.
>=20
> Still, Clinton has the bigger war chest. The New York senator reported =
$24.1 million available for her primary campaign, bolstered by $10 =
million from her Senate re-election campaign. She also raised an =
additional $6.9 million that only can be used in a general election =
campaign.
>=20
> Obama (D-Ill.) reported $18.2 million left after expenses to spend on =
the primary. He reported an additional $1 million available for the =
later campaign.
>=20
> Though both Clinton and Obama have held a series of big-dollar =
fundraisers, Clinton has relied more on wealthy donors who contributed =
the maximum legal contribution of $2,300 each to both the primary and =
general election campaigns.
>=20
> Funds for the general election provide no strategic advantage during =
the primary contest since they must be kept separate and cannot be spent =
until after a candidate receives their party's nomination.
>=20
> Clinton and Obama spent their campaign funds at a similar rate, with =
both reporting a little under $7 million in combined expenses and =
accumulated debts. And they were considerably more frugal than the two =
leading Republican spenders: Mitt Romney, who spent $11.6 million and =
showed no unpaid bills other than a loan to the campaign from his =
personal funds, and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who showed $10.2 million =
in expenses and accumulated debts.
>=20
> Clinton and Obama each dominated fundraising on their home turf.
>=20
> Clinton raised more than twice as much than Obama from New York City =
addresses, while Obama bested Clinton's Chicago fundraising, collecting =
nearly 15 times as much as she did in the Second City. Obama raised $2.1 =
million from people listing Chicago addresses, while Clinton pulled in =
$4.5 million from the Big Apple.
>=20
> Although Obama has focused much of his efforts on building a network =
of small donors, he raised the legal limit from about 4,800 of his =
104,000 contributors for the primary campaign, while Clinton hit that =
level with about 5,100 of her 60,000 donors. For each campaign, that =
relatively wealthy sliver of their donor base contributed a big share of =
their money -- more than $11 million to each campaign for spending on =
the primary.
>=20
> Democrat John Edwards reported raising $13 million for the primary, =
with $9.8 million in cash available to campaign for the party nomination =
and a little more than $900,000 for the general election.
>=20
> Edwards saw a surge in donor support after the announcement that his =
wife's breast cancer had returned. He raised about $5.4 million =
following the late-March revelation, more than a third of his total for =
the quarter.
>=20
> While the first votes will not be cast until the Iowa caucuses next =
January, the candidates already are engaged in a struggle to build =
financial resources for a primary season that most political =
professionals expect will be extraordinarily costly. Major candidates =
are expected to spend $100 million or more.
>=20
> The money chase has accelerated this election because early primaries =
are bunched and a slew of large states have moved their primaries to =
early in the year, making costly television advertising especially =
important. The major candidates also have indicated they will not accept =
public funds, meaning they do not have to abide by spending limits that =

> CORRECTION: This story contains corrected material, published April =
19, 2007.
>=20
> A man recently released from prison is accused of setting a fast- =
moving fire early Sunday that engulfed his cousin's home, killing five =
of her children, authorities and a family member said.
>=20
> A family member said Zachary Meeks, 27, had quarreled with the cousin, =
Jeanette Clark, half an hour earlier in a casino bar over his role in a =
family feud. Their brief fight at the Casino Starlite Terrace ended =
after she slapped him, said Michelle Pleasant (the name as published has =
been corrected here and in subsequent references in this text), who said =
she is Clark's friend (the relationship of Michelle Pleasant to the =
children's mother has been corrected in this text).
>=20
> Meeks left calmly, she said.
>=20
> "I can't believe it escalated to this," Pleasant said. "Maybe it would =
be easier to deal with if it was just one, but it was all of them and =
they were innocent."
>=20
> Adams County Coroner Gary Hamilton identified the victims as Kendall =
Edwards, 10; Althea Clark, 9; Cameron Clark, 7 and Khalil Clark, 5.; and =
Kejuan Clark, 5 months (this sentence as published has been corrected in =
this text). Four were found on the second floor of the two-story brick =
house and one was on the first floor.
>=20
> Jeanette Clark, their mother, had moved the family to this town on the =
banks of the Mississippi River from Chicago's South Side two years ago =
in search of small-town simplicity, Pleasant said.
>=20
> "We were trying to leave the crazy life behind," Pleasant said.
>=20
> Meeks, accused of starting the fire about 3 a.m., was arrested about 6 =
a.m. when police were called to a fight at his home two blocks away, =
authorities said. Meeks' mother, Pamela Meeks- Washington, said several =
family members went to her son's home to confront him about the fire.
>=20
> He was pistol whipped, but not seriously injured, she said.
>=20
> He was being held Sunday on five counts of first-degree murder, arson =
and aggravated arson, police said. Formal charges will be filed Monday, =
authorities said.
>=20
> Meeks-Washington, 46, of Joliet, said her son is a father of three. He =
has a history of drug and alcohol abuse and long been treated for =
depression, she said. He baby-sat for the dead children, she said.
>=20
> He was born on the South Side, but has lived most of his life in =
Quincy, she said.
>=20
> "He loved those kids," Meeks-Washington said. "He'd play with them, =
and he'd watch them. He wouldn't hurt them."
>=20
> Meeks was paroled by the Illinois Department of Corrections in =
December on a drug charge. He also was convicted in 2002 of aggravated =
battery, according to the Department of Corrections.
>=20
> Pleasant said she was at the casino with the children's parents, =
Jeanette and Keith Clark, about 2:30 a.m. Sunday when Meeks approached.
>=20
> Police confirmed that Meeks had been in a quarrel with someone injured =
in the fire, but would not elaborate. They also would not say how the =
fire was set, but said physical evidence ties Meeks to the crime.
>=20
> Authorities declined to release preliminary causes of death and said =
autopsies are planned.
>=20
> Pleasant said she came home from the bar to see the house engulfed and =
her sister and brother-in-law screaming and crying. Police said a woman =
had to be hospitalized after she broke free from firefighters and tried =
to crawl through a window to get to the children.
>=20
> Family members said the woman was Jeanette Clark, who was discharged =
later in the day. Police said Keith Clark remained hospitalized in =
Springfield for burns.
>=20
> Sue Johnson, who lives across the street from the home, said she heard =
the sound of a car door slamming and tires squealing about the time of =
the fire, but went back to sleep. She awoke to firetrucks and flashing =
lights in front of her home.
>=20
> "I wish I would have gotten up and looked out," she said. "Maybe I =
could have saw the fire when it started and they could have got out."
>=20
> Police said it is unclear if the children's parents were home when the =
fire began and that the case has been reported to the Department of =
Children and Family Services.
>=20
> Neighbors said the family attended church every Sunday and that the =
kids were a regular fixture in the neighborhood, often playing in their =
front yard.
>=20
> "They were the sweetest kids," said Arlene Petty, a neighbor. "It's =
hard to think that one day you are watching them play ball and watching =
them ride their bikes and the next you are watching their bodies being =
carried out."
>=20
> The Clarks have two other children who were not home Saturday night, =
Pleasant said.
>=20
> By Sunday evening, a 6-foot cross had been erected in front of the =
house alongside a statue of an angel and vases of fresh flowers.

> Full text:
> Getting slow-poke customers to pay their bills on time, or reasonably =
on time, can be a vexing problem for a small-business owner. Besides =
creating cash-flow issues, late payments can be a time and energy waster =
if it takes phone calls and e-mails to get a customer to finally send a =
check.
>=20
> Business owners who have struggled with the problem have a variety of =
ways to deal with the problem, including educating customers about =
payment terms, insisting on a substantial deposit before work begins or =
hiring someone to keep after the foot- draggers.
>=20
> Some business owners have found that unless they are clear at the =
beginning about payment terms, customers may take their time. It is =
human nature to put things off, and all of us have to prioritize what we =
use money for. But if a company states from the get-go, "Here is how we =
need to be paid," a customer is more likely to get the message.
>=20
> Dana Korey lost time and productivity at her professional organizing =
business trying to collect on invoices weeks or months after they were =
sent out. Korey, founder of Away With Clutter Inc. in Del Mar, Calif., =
said "being really clear about the deposit and being exceptionally clear =
about the day the balance would be due" turned the situation around.
>=20
> Korey raised the deposit to 60 percent from 50 percent, put payment =
terms in bold-face type in contracts and had customers sign or initial =
every provision that dealt with payment. Employees also state the =
payment terms aloud during the contract-signing process.
>=20
> "It actually has worked phenomenally," she said of the changes.
>=20
> Gini Dietrich said her Chicago-based public relations firm, Arment =
Dietrich, would have had to go out of business because of slow payments =
if she hadn't implemented a payment policy, because its cash flow was so =
poor
>=20
> "Literally, I was playing bank for my clients," she said.
>=20
> Dietrich added, "I wasn't very good at asking for the money," =
something that many business owners can identify with.
>=20
> Her solution has been to require two months' retainer fees up front, =
refuse to give discounts for early payments (many companies will shrug =
off the discount and pay later, she said) and insist on out-of-pocket =
expenses to be paid up front.
>=20
> And, if an invoice is more than 45 days past due, work on the project =
stops immediately.
>=20
> The result: Dietrich stayed in business and has a healthy cash flow.
>=20
> Carol Borow and Dan Venet say their slow-payment problems have been =
made easier because they have an employee whose duties including calling =
customers who haven't paid. Borow and Venet, who own CHB Industries =
Inc., a New York-based provider of window film, don't spend their time =
chasing late payments unless the situation really demands their =
intervention.
>=20
> "It's often very helpful to make sure that payment terms are =
negotiated up front, and if you can get a deposit up front, that's =
better," Borow said.
>=20
> Small-business owners who want to develop a payment policy have plenty =
of resources, starting with other company owners, especially if they are =
in the same industry, and their accountants. Talking to veterans of the =
bill-paying wars can help you figure out what kind of terms you want to =
institute.
>=20
> But there are things you can do that go beyond contract terms. For =
companies that deal with other businesses, having a good relationship, =
with open lines of communication, can help ease the process. So if you =
or one of your top employees needs to prod your customer for a payment, =
the phone call will be a reminder not only of the obligation that needs =
to be met, but also of the fact that there is a good relationship that =
needs to be preserved.
>=20
> And, remember, sometimes customers don't pay because they are unhappy =
with the job. Having good communications can help head off that problem, =
allowing you to hear that something is wrong.

> For several years a Chicago entrepreneur has labored quietly building =
a company to create an alternative to batteries for powering cell phones =
and other small gadgets.
>=20
> The company, Lattice Energy LLC, deliberately kept a low profile =
because its core technology, first called cold fusion 18 years ago, has =
long been ridiculed by mainstream scientists. Lewis Larsen, Lattice's =
founder, didn't want his enterprise tainted by the empty promises of =
unlimited cheap energy surrounding cold fusion.
>=20
> Larsen, who has had careers in investment banking and consulting, has =
worked with many scientists doing experiments with what now is called =
low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR) rather than cold fusion. Even with =
the name change, he said, many scientists mistakenly still believe they =
are creating nuclear fusion in a bottle when they thrust palladium or =
other metals into heavy water and add energy.
>=20
> "A lot of people are doing very good chemistry experiments, but they =
don't understand what's happening," Larsen said. "They write fine papers =
but then add foolish speculation."
>=20
> A few years ago Larsen began collaborating with a theoretical =
physicist, professor Allan Widom of Northeastern University in Boston, =
to help him understand why LENR experiments often give off heat and =
charged particles.
>=20
> Before taking on the assignment, Widom was a skeptic, but Larsen =
showed him enough experimental results from laboratories in Russia, =
China and Japan, as well as the U.S., to convince him that something =
important was happening.
>=20
> The problem soon became apparent to Widom: The experimenters were =
convinced that atoms of a form of hydrogen called deuterium were fusing =
together to form helium.
>=20
> "That kind of fusion requires very high temperatures," Widom said.
>=20
> Rather than look for other explanations, most experimenters preferred =
to invent new laws of physics to account for cold fusion, Widom said. =
But instead of a strong nuclear force like fusion at work, he concluded =
that a weak force was at the core of the experimental results. Electrons =
were combining with protons to form neutrons, giving off energy in the =
process.
>=20
> The entrepreneur and the professor have published their Widom- Larsen =
theory of low-energy nuclear reactions and have been meeting with =
business executives and government officials to build credibility for =
their ideas.
>=20
> "Our model invokes no new physics," said Widom. "Everything we've done =
conforms to the Standard Model's predictions for weak interactions."
>=20
> With advances in nanotechnology, Larsen predicts it will become =
practical to design devices using LENR to power cell phones that can =
last 500 hours. The technology also might be used to produce power in =
other settings, but Larsen said, "We're going for the best available =
market with lots of demand, and that's electronic mobile devices."
>=20
> Larsen, who has competitors domestically and abroad also working on =
the problem, predicts that within five years there will be power sources =
based on LENR technology.
>=20
> FREE INFORMATION: Last week Google launched a test version of its free =
directory-assistance service.
>=20
> You call 1-800-GOOG-411 and talk to a computer to ask for a business =
phone number. When we tried it, asking for "Chicago Tribune," it =
requested a cross street or ZIP code. We entered "60611," and the =
machine was ready to connect our call, all for no charge.
>=20
> The service works only for business numbers and reportedly has some =
problems understanding some spoken language, but as bugs are worked out =
it could become a big concern for traditional phone companies that =
charge $1.25 or more each time you dial 411.

3,500 real estate agents, rose an annual 6.7 percent, to 173,400 pounds =
($340,700), the London-based research company said. The increase was the =
most since June 2003. For the month, prices rose 0.8 percent, led by a =
1.8 percent gain in the capital, the most since July 2002.

recently.

> International Business Machines Corp., the world's largest =
computer-services provider, has created a unit to process loans for =
mortgage companies as they try to cope with waning demand and rising =
defaults.
>=20
> Loan applications, underwriting, document preparation and closings are =
among services IBM will provide, said a company statement. The unit will =
use systems from FileNet Corp. and Palisades Technology Partners, two of =
more than 10 software companies IBM bought last year.
>=20
> Mortgage lenders use outsourcing companies such as PHH Corp. to avoid =
the cost of maintaining their own back-office operations, and as buffers =
against big swings in volume as home sales and refinancings rise and =
fall. The Washington-based Mortgage Bankers Association expects new =
loans to drop 9 percent to $2.28 trillion this year. More than 30 =
lenders closed or sought buyers since the start of 2006.
>=20
> "Clearly lenders are at some of their highest pain points," said Greg =
Sullins, the head of the new unit, dubbed IBM Lender Business Process =
Services Inc. "To us, that translates to opportunities."
>=20
> About a quarter of IBM's clients are financial-services companies, and =
their industry is the largest source of revenue for the Armonk, =
N.Y.-based company, Sullins said. The new unit employs 60 people and =
probably will add "several hundred" employees in its Charlotte =
headquarters over the next 12 months, he added.
>=20

clients showing "strong interest" and expects to have some signed by the =
third quarter, Sullins said. It and expects to have "predominantly =
U.S.-based operations," he said.
>=20

Lynch & Co. and Charles Schwab Corp.

> Full text:
> In an era of do-it-yourself retirement planning, workers often are =
hobbled by a lack of clear information on their investments and the fees =
they are charged to manage them.
>=20
> Those fees can eat away tens of thousands of dollars over time. Now, =
federal regulators are seeking to toughen disclosure rules and devise a =
single standard for a wide variety of investments and retirement plans.
>=20
> Saying current disclosures often are "missing the mark by a country =
mile," Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox said =
his agency would seek new rules that would force mutual funds, insurance =
companies and others to more clearly detail the cost and performance of =
investment funds and retirement plans.
>=20
> In an interview, Cox said companies that manage funds and retirement =
plans should be required to report "one simple number that captures fees =
and expenses." As traditional pensions disappear, more workers are =
relying on 401(k)'s and individual retirement accounts. But excessive =
fees can jeopardize the financial security of retirees.
>=20
> These costs are often hidden, either buried in the fine print of a =
fund prospectus or simply deducted from accounts without ever showing up =
as a line-item expense.
>=20
> "It's our top regulatory priority," said Cox, who wants to make it =
easier to compare funds. "There are always technical concerns raised by =
someone, but the truth is that apples-to-apples comparisons are quite =
useful for consumers. The same should be possible for our retirement =
savings."
>=20
> Mutual funds, for example, provide information about fund fees and =
trading costs in different parts of the prospectus but don't add them =
up. Annuities sold by insurance companies, meanwhile, are typically tied =
to the performance of an underlying mutual fund, but the return of that =
fund is often not clearly reported, critics say.
>=20
> Requiring easy-to-read disclosures may be challenging, given the =
complexity of retirement plans.
>=20
> "It's a good concept: giving people simple, easily comparable =
information," said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the =
Consumer Federation of America. "The question is whether they'll come up =
with a number that is really meaningful."
>=20
> There also is no single regulator. The SEC oversees mutual funds, but =
it does not regulate retirement plans offered by insurance companies, =
banks and other firms that administer retirement plans. To implement new =
standards that apply across the board, Cox would need the support of =
other agencies.
>=20
> The Department of Labor, which has broad authority over employer- =
sponsored retirement plans, including 401(k) plans, has been pursuing =
its own disclosure initiative and said it supports the broad effort.
>=20
> At the top levels of the SEC, the view is that far-reaching changes in =
the pension landscape require the effort. Self-directed retirement plans =
such as 401(k)'s usually are linked to the performance of the financial =
markets, making the decisions of investors, and the bite of fees, =
crucial.
>=20
> "If the government expects retirees to manage their own accounts, they =
need to know how their investments are doing, and right now many don't =
know how they are doing," SEC Commissioner Roel Campos said.
>=20
> The initiative will be rolled out in phases. In the coming months, the =
SEC hopes to hold round tables of experts and to publish a concept paper =
outlining the issue, paving the way for a formal rule proposal this =
year.
>=20
> Some observers maintain that stricter requirements are most needed for =
plans run by insurers and other companies that are not under the direct =
scrutiny of the SEC.
>=20
> "I'm very surprised there hasn't been more focus on these kinds of =
investment products," said Brent Glading, managing director of Glading =
Group, a Montclair, N.J., firm that analyzes retirement plans for =
employers.
>=20
> Lobbyists for the insurance, banking and mutual fund industries all =
said they supported clear disclosures for the public.
>=20
> At the same time, they said cost was not the only factor that =
determined the attraction of a retirement plan and urged the public to =
consider other matters as well, such as the choices a plan offered and =
their suitability to an individual's needs.
>=20
> For its part, the SEC may propose a separate rule aimed at enhancing =
the disclosures of mutual funds. The idea is that improved mutual fund =
disclosures would make a significant difference because much of the =
money in self-directed retirement plans, such as 401(k)'s and IRAs, is =
invested in mutual funds.
>=20
> Studies have shown that many workers are unaware of the fees they pay =
to run their retirement plans, which can be significant.
>=20
> In a report in November, the Government Accountability Office said a =
retirement nest egg of $20,000 might grow to $70,500 after 20 years, =
presuming annual returns of 7 percent and annual fees of 0.5 percent.
>=20
> By contrast, that same $20,000 nest egg would grow to only $58,400 if =
the annual fees totaled 1.5 percent, according to the GAO.
>=20
> "Differences of even a fraction of a percent can matter enormously =
over time," Cox said. "Investors deserve to know the after-tax, =
after-fees performance of their fund and to know whether the manager was =
good or lucky."

> "I had a team in the CBA that finished .500 one season," coach Phil =
Jackson said late Friday night after an eighth loss in 10 games dropped =
his Los Angeles Lakers to 40-40. "I never missed the playoffs, but that =
was the toughest year."
>=20
> This one is moving up the Jackson list quickly. The newest member of =
the Basketball Hall of Fame and arguably the game's most successful =
coach agrees the Lakers probably need to win their final two games just =
to make the playoffs after being 13 games above .500 at midseason.
>=20
> "I never envisioned this," Kobe Bryant acknowledged.
>=20
> Nobody around the Lakers did either, including Jackson, after a =
revival season last year and a seven-game, opening-round playoff =
thriller with the Suns. But the Lakers have been crippled with major =
injuries, and Jackson concedes that if the team wasn't trying to avoid a =
playoff death spiral, Lamar Odom and Luke Walton probably wouldn't be =
playing with the ankle and shoulder injuries that kept them out major =
parts of the season.
>=20
> So the Lakers try to hold it together starting 19-year-old Andrew =
Bynum, whom they targeted for the D-League before the season, or Ronny =
Turiaf, returning after heart surgery, and Smush Parker, essentially the =
first player in Jackson's 25 years of coaching who has been openly =
defiant.
>=20
> Parker has been the "Animal House" kid in the back of the room =
mumbling under his breath during Jackson talks, derisively saying he =
gave up trying to read "the man." After a loss to the Suns last week, =
Parker remarked how much he enjoyed the game because he scored 25 =
points.
>=20
> Kwame Brown, who was so important as the Lakers won 11 of 14 down the =
stretch last season, seems to be refusing to play. Earlier this season =
he was accused in what was believed to be the NBA's first food-fight =
arrest, when he took a man's cake and threw it at a teammate. Jackson =
this week pulled a white handkerchief from his breast pocket and waved =
it when reporters asked about the indifferent Brown, who didn't =
accompany the team.
>=20
> In the middle of it all, seething in a familiar scene Jackson has seen =
before, is Bryant, scoring 50 points in a game last week for the ninth =
time this season, the most times anyone has done that since Wilt =
Chamberlain in 1964-65.

> "He feels like he has had to score to keep us competitive rather than =
score to help us win," Jackson said.
>=20
> Jackson compares it with what he saw from Michael Jordan as a Bulls =
assistant in 1987 and 1988.
>=20
> Jordan piled up points and frustrations with a losing team before =
personnel additions sent the Bulls on a path toward their championships.
>=20
> Jackson has one season left on his contract and has been discussing an =
extension with management, which is something of a family affair in that =
he still dates the owner's daughter, team executive Jeannie Buss. But =
Jackson says he wants to determine the direction of the team before =
making a commitment, and he doesn't see the owner needing a $10 million =
coach for rebuilding.
>=20
> No, Jackson is not taking a pay cut.
>=20
> But you also can take it to the bank that Bryant isn't on board for =
any rebuilding.
>=20
> "He has been angry," Jackson said. "He has been challenging his =
players after games."
>=20
> Jackson saw plenty of that in his early years with the Bulls. Bryant =
and Jordan, meanwhile, have developed an interesting bond over the past =
year and are often in contact.
>=20
> Associates say it is challenging, as one might expect knowing their =
similarly competitive personalities.
>=20
> Jordan wonders how Bryant would do against the better talent he =
(Jordan) played against and the rules he played under, including =
hand-checking that allowed a strong defender like Mitch Richmond to =
affect his movement.
>=20
> Jordan, though, didn't have to face the zones Bryant now sees.
>=20
> One of my favorite stories involves a pick-and-roll Jordan ran once =
with Bill Cartwright, who was open at the basket.
>=20
> Jordan shot.
>=20
> As they went to the sideline after the play, Cartwright asked Jordan =
why he didn't pass. Jordan replied that one of the double- teaming =
defenders was Fred Roberts. Translation: I can beat my man and him.
>=20
> Which is why, when Bryant had that remarkable run of 50-point games =
last month, most of his scoring came on jumpers.
>=20
> The loss to the Suns on Friday was an example.
>=20
> The Suns usually double-teamed Bryant on the catch and then dropped =
another player into a zone. Thus a 93-85 game.
>=20
> Not that it ever was easy to average more than 30 points per game, as =
Jordan did back then, but Jackson's first message to Jordan when he =
became head coach in 1989 was that sharing the ball leads to =
championships, not scoring titles.
>=20
> Jordan was so good he could do both. That's Bryant's challenge.
>=20
> Bryant is about to win his second straight scoring championship, but =
it's not getting Jackson and the Lakers anywhere. As Jordan liked to say =
way back when, "Pass to who?"
>=20
> "Kobe is like Michael," Jackson said. "He can't take the losing. I've =
enjoyed coaching this team. I worry for them. They are good guys and =
they have a good time. We've had some disheartening losses. I think =
they're getting used to it. That's what bothers me."

25, 2007. Milton was born April 8, 1913 in Chicago to Frank and Jessie, =
nee DeYoung, Tuttle. Milton is survived by his wife Evelyn, nee Howe, of =
69 years. He was the loving father of Marcy (William) Vedral and dearest =
grandfather of Lynn (James) Konsbruck and Lisa Vedral (Brian Ploof). =
Milton attended Maine Township High School, graduated from Northwestern =
University and went on to Chicago-Kent College of Law. Milton opened his =

Peace and a Township Tax Collector. One of Milton's greatest moments was =
becoming a Lion in 1944. He was a life member of the Des Plaines Lions =
Club. Past International Director Tuttle recorded 60 years of perfect =
attendance. He held many offices within the association including =
President, District Governor, Chairman of two International District =

Ambassador of Good Will, the highest award which can be presented to a =
Lion member by Lions Clubs International, thirteen International =
President's Awards, two International Leadership awards, Melvin Jones =
Fellow Award, International Extension Award for the organization of the =

> The U.S. envoy to North Korea's nuclear talks said Saturday that a =
2-month-old disarmament plan lacks "momentum" as North Korea failed to =
meet a deadline for shutting down its main nuclear reactor and =
processing facility.
>=20
> "We don't have a lot of momentum right now," U.S. Assistant Secretary =
of State Christopher Hill told reporters in Beijing before meeting his =
Chinese counterpart, Wu Dawei.
>=20
> The disarmament plan, reached in February after nearly four years of =
arduous negotiations, laid out a timetable for North Korea to dismantle =
its nuclear programs. The plan was unexpectedly disrupted by a dispute =
over frozen North Korean funds in a Macau bank that Washington said last =
week was finally resolved.
>=20
> On Friday, Hill did not say what the consequences would be if the =
North missed the Saturday deadline.
>=20
> As part of the disarmament agreement, the North was supposed to gain =
access to $25 million in frozen funds at the Banco Delta Asia bank in =
the Chinese territory of Macau. Washington blacklisted the bank in =
September 2005 for allegedly helping the North launder money and pass =
counterfeit $100 bills.
>=20
> The funds were unblocked last week, but North Korea's Foreign Ministry =
said Friday that it was still confirming the release. The ministry said =
the country would carry out its side of the February agreement "when the =
lifting of the sanction is proved to be a reality."

rose outnumbered those showing declines by 36 percentage points, the =
most since the survey began in 1994, the Royal Institution of Chartered =
Surveyors said. In the U.K., the net balance was 28 percentage points, =

>=20
> Britain's building industry, which accounts for 6 percent of the =
economy, expanded the most in three quarters in the final three months =
of 2006.
>=20
> A shortage of places to live and work in London is spurring a rash of =
construction, including the city's first 1,000-foot skyscraper.
>=20
> "Private commercial building in London is at an all-time high, that's =
what's driven workloads up," said David Stubbs, senior economist at the =
surveyors agency. "In the U.K., we had a decent pickup in 2006 and it's =
going to be an even better 2007."
>=20
> London's financial district is attracting investors in commercial =
buildings amid a rise in rents.
>=20
> London Mayor Ken Livingstone is encouraging more skyscrapers in the =
city, where the highest building is the 800-foot-tall Canary Wharf =
Tower, to make better use of limited space. The biggest yet will be the =
1,016-foot Shard of Glass, which was designed by Renzo Piano and will =
stand on the South Bank of the Thames by London Bridge.
>=20
> "On the commercial side, retail is slightly weak, industrial is OK, =
and the offices market is doing the best," Stubbs said. "There's still =
tremendous pent-up demand in the housing market too."
>=20
> House prices rose 6.7 percent in March from a year earlier, the most =
in almost four years, property research company Hometrack Ltd. said =
March 26. London and the southeast of England led gains, outpacing Wales =
and the North of England, where values were unchanged.

> Canadian new-home starts rebounded from their lowest point in more =
than three years in March, as demand for urban housing increased.
>=20
> Housing starts rose to 210,900 on an annual basis from 196,000 in =
February, when colder-than-normal temperatures crimped construction, =
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. said.
>=20
> New-home construction, which has been a major contributor to the =
country's economic growth, will decline this year because of higher =
prices for homes and rising mortgage costs, the Ottawa-based CMHC and =
the Bank of Canada have said. Starts will finish the year at 209,500 =
units, down from 227,395 in 2006, the housing agency predicted last =
month.
>=20
> Even as building increased in March, "housing starts are gradually =
trending lower," Bob Dugan, the agency's chief economist, said in a =
statement. "This downward trend is consistent with our view that housing =
starts in 2007 will be lower than in 2006."
>=20
> Building expanded 7.3 percent last year, making construction the =
fastest-growing industry in the country.
>=20
> Starts in Canadian cities rose 9.1 percent to 177,900 units during =
March, led by multiple-family units such as condominiums. The prairie =
provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba led the gain, with a =
combined 26 percent increase to 49,200 units.
>=20
> "Although Canada's housing market remains on solid footing, we expect =
to see starts decline to about 200,000 by the end of the year, as the =
housing market cools from its unsustainably hot pace of the last few =
years," Jacqui Douglas, an economist with TD Securities in Toronto, said =
in a note to clients.

about their efforts toward peace in the Mideast. An edited transcript =
follows:
>=20
> What motivated you to participate in the tour?
>=20
> Dor: I see the U.S. playing a very important role in the power dynamic =
back home, influencing and encouraging the occupation. What I'm trying =
to do is to say to [the American] people: Start asking questions. You =
have a responsibility for the Israeli occupation and you need to start =
acknowledging it, and start acting to change it.
>=20
> Nassar: I'm here to raise awareness of what is happening in Palestine. =
I see more confiscating of [Palestinian] land, expanding of [Israeli] =
settlements [in the West Bank], building a wall which [strangles] the =
Palestinians economically and socially. What we are trying to do is =
stand against the situation and not to give up.
>=20
> What are the most common questions you get from audiences?
>=20
> Dor: As a Jewish Israeli from South Africa, the most common question I =
get is what do I think of [Jimmy] Carter's book ["Palestine: Peace Not =
Apartheid"]. Most people are commenting because of the title. It created =
a lot of anger in Israel and among Jews around the world. [They] do not =
like to make the comparison. It is something that makes us feel bad. I =
say of course it's not the same; the narrative is not the same. ... =
[But] you can say the roads going to the [Jewish] settlements are =
apartheid. You can see the difference in colors of [Palestinian] =
identity cards, like the different colors that were given to black South =
Africans. These colors define your freedom of movement. This is =
something we don't like to look at. We have to look at it.
>=20
> Do you think Americans have an accurate picture of the conflict =
between Israelis and Palestinians?
>=20
> Abu Arqoub: I know for sure they do not have a clue. They miss the =
daily suffering of the Palestinians. They are not familiar with the =
power dynamics. The American people think there is a conflict between =
two equals. They don't know it's not true.
>=20
> Dor: I think Americans have the same idea I got growing up in Israel. =
For example, one of the things said to us is "Palestinian terrorist" and =
"Israeli Defense Force." We use these terms all the time, of course. But =
you'd think at least the international [community] would say "Wait, who =
has more weapons?" So it amazes me that one is considered terrorist and =
one is considered defense.

> The international community maintains that Hamas has not explicitly =
recognized Israel or agreed to accept previous peace agreements. Both =
Israel and America consider it a terrorist organization. Why should =
Israel negotiate with a government that includes Hamas?
>=20
> Abu Arqoub: First of all, Hamas recognized Israel and wanted to =
negotiate, but the door was slammed in their face. They offered a truce =
more than once. [Think of] Hamas like the Sinn Fein. Internally, Hamas =
is going through the same process as Sinn Fein. But nobody is sponsoring =
the change. The international community is saying, "No, you are a =
terrorist organization." It's damaging to their internal efforts to =
evolve into a political party. They are not being given the chance.
>=20
> Dor: I think that this whole discourse of Hamas not recognizing Israel =
is a bit ironic when Israel is not recognizing the Palestinians. They =
don't recognize them as a nation, as a people.
>=20
> Some of the brightest minds in the diplomatic world have been =
searching for a formula to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for =
years. Why is it so difficult to reach an agreement that both sides can =
accept?
>=20
> Abu Arqoub: I think the problem is in the definition of a viable =
[Palestinian] state. What do we mean by a viable state? [Will] the =
[border crossings] be in the hands of [the Israelis]? What about the =
question of settlements? If every time the Israeli army feels they need =
to get inside the West Bank because of the settlements, then I have no =
country. I have no state.
>=20
> Dor: I want to rephrase the question. This word peace negotiation is =
an illusion. You cannot speak about peace when there is occupation. Four =
weeks ago [Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas] and [Israeli Prime =
Minister Ehud Olmert] met, shaking hands on television. It was very -- =
wow -- amazing meeting. At the same time, for that whole week, the =
Israeli army invaded the [Palestinian] city of Nablus.
>=20
> Nassar: Israel mixes religion [into the conflict]. We have to go every =
now and then to a [military] court in Ramallah [on the West Bank]. =
[Editor's note: The Nassar family is fighting confiscation of its land =
near Bethlehem.] In one of the court sessions, the judge asked about our =
documents and maps. We had everything from 1924. Then the other side =
said, "We have a paper from God." They stood up with a small piece of =
paper and said, "We have it from God."
>=20
> Do Israelis and Palestinians have the same definition of a Palestinian =
state?
>=20
> Abu Arqoub: I don't think they have the same definition. To the =
Palestinian, a state is viable. It has sovereignty. It has borders. It =
has access to the outside world. It has structure, geographical =
continuity. To the Israelis, a [Palestinian] state is one that they can =
enter into every time they feel their security is threatened.
>=20
> Dor: I believe if Israel really wanted a Palestinian state, it would =
have happened already. But everything is going on not to let it happen. =
I think this talk about two states is again a manipulative discourse.
>=20
> What about the Israelis who say that if they relinquish the West Bank =
the Palestinians will use it as a launching pad to liberate the rest of =
historic Palestine, which is now Israel?
>=20
> Dor: I would say, "I am not afraid." I would say, "Go speak to =
Palestinians." Most Palestinians don't speak about throwing the Jews =
into the sea. We must not do to the Palestinians what we are assuming =
maybe they will do to us. We have to acknowledge that most of the =
Palestinians want to live in peace.
>=20
> Isn't part of the problem that Palestinian refugees insist on =
returning to land that is now in Israel?
>=20
> Dor: I'm not sure all the refugees will want to come back anyway. But =
we have to discuss how they can come back. We have to talk about =
justice.
>=20
> Abu Arqoub: They can go to the West Bank when the West Bank is a =
viable state.
>=20
> There has been a lot of criticism of the barrier that separates Israel =
from the West Bank. But suicide bombings have gone down since it was =
built. Do you think the wall makes Israel more secure?
>=20
> Abu Arqoub: [Fewer bombs are] not because of the wall. It's because =
the militant groups decided to play politics. I've managed to get into =
Jerusalem [by circumventing Israeli checkpoints]. I could have had a =
bomb on me. That's why I believe the sense of security in Israel is =
twisted. It has nothing to do with [the wall]. If Hamas and Islamic =
Jihad have the intention of doing a suicide bombing in Israel, they will =
do it. The wall is not going to stop them.
>=20
> Dor: I disagree. I think the wall did reduce the amount of suicide =
bombings. [It] is reducing the bombing but it's increasing the hatred. =
When you close people in ghettos, when people have nothing to lose, they =
will find ways to resist. I believe it will get worse because of the =
wall. Israel is creating a more dangerous place.

> It'll soon be decision time for my wife, Georgina, and me. Four =
short-term certificates of deposit totaling 10 percent of our fixed- =
income portfolio will come due during the next four months.
>=20
> The fact that we have CDs has surprised some readers who expect a =
financial columnist to seek investments with the potential for higher =
returns. And Georgina and I do, with a significant chunk of our =
portfolio in low-cost, broadly diversified stock mutual funds.
>=20
> But we also diversify with fixed-income investments and are pleased =
with how our short-term CDs, all for 13 months or less and yielding =
between 5.2 percent and 5.8 percent a year, have stabilized our =
portfolio while providing dependable income.
>=20
> We plan to replace the maturing CDs with longer-term fixed- income =
investments, either other CDs and/or investment-grade bonds with =
staggered maturities from 2013 through 2017.
>=20
> We already own fixed-income investments coming due every year from =
2008 through 2012.
>=20
> While our strategy is not for everyone, the subject is timely given =
the subprime mortgage problems roiling the credit markets, the mixed =
signals about the economy and the billions of dollars coming due in =
short-term CDs. For most of us, the basic reason for fixed- income =
investments is not to chase yields or speculate on the direction of =
interest rates but to smooth out the volatility of a portfolio and/or =
create a stable and dependable source of cash flow.
>=20
> For that latter purpose, it's hard to beat "laddering," the strategy =
of investing in an assortment of bonds (Bank CDs are just one form of =
bonds.) with different maturities.
>=20
> With laddering, if interest rates fall, bonds that mature soon will =
have to be reinvested at a lower rate. But the other bonds in the =
portfolio would continue to pay above-market rates. If interest rates =
rise, the total portfolio might pay a below-market return, but the =
maturing bonds can be reinvested at higher rates.
>=20
> "The point is to create a stable source of cash you can always rely =
on," said John Radtke, executive director of Incapital LLC, an =
underwriter and distributor of fixed-income securities based in Chicago =
and Ft. Lauderdale.
>=20
> In addition, "having a small amount in cash or short-term CDs is =
probably not a bad idea" now, Radtke said, considering their yields =
approach, match or sometimes even exceed those of longer-term high- =
quality bonds. With close to $100 billion in short-term CDs coming due =
this year in the United States, many banks are offering special rates on =
short-term certificates to entice customers to renew.
>=20
> If all your money is in short-term deposits, however, you run the risk =
that interest rates will drop by the time they mature.
>=20
> "If concerns about the housing industry persist, the likelihood of the =
Fed cutting rates is significant," Radtke said, a move that would lead =
banks to lower the interest rate on CDs.
>=20
> To counter that risk, Radtke suggests rounding off your fixed- income =
portfolio with intermediate- and longer-term bonds that are rated =
investment grade. The latter point is significant. If capital =
preservation and reliable income are your goals, you want to stay away =
from riskier high-yield or "junk" bonds, even if they tempt you with =
juicy yields.
>=20
> How many bonds to buy and how far to extend maturities will depend on =
individual circumstances, including how much money you have to invest, =
your age and need for cash flow. You also need to be aware of whether a =
bond can be "called," or redeemed by the issuer before maturity. "You =
want to customize the cash flow as much as possible," so you receive =
income when you need it, Radtke said.

> Full text:
> Seeking to become the greenest city in the country, Cambridge, Mass., =
will launch a sweeping $70 million energy efficiency program to conserve =
energy in virtually every building within city boundaries, reducing =
emissions that contribute to global warming.
>=20
> University, commercial, and even residential buildings will receive =
energy audits over the next five years to pinpoint energy =
inefficiencies. Property owners will then be offered low- or zero- =
interest loans to undertake remediation efforts ranging from replacing =
incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescents to installing =
insulated roofs and more efficient heating and cooling systems.
>=20
> "The notion of a city as a platform on which to build massive energy =
efficiency is the critical innovation," said Douglas I. Foy, former =
Massachusetts secretary of commonwealth development, who is advising =
Cambridge officials. "Cities are the Saudi Arabia of energy efficiency, =
a mine of massive efficiency opportunities."
>=20
> The energy efficiency measures will be financed by loans made from a =
$70 million fund, most of which will be raised from private sources by =
investment bank Bostonia Partners LLC. Large capital improvement costs =
may be shared by the program and the building owners.
>=20
> Cambridge officials expect that as the city demonstrates progress on =
reducing electricity use, they can qualify to receive money from a $1 =
billion-a-year fund that the operator of the regional electric power =
grid collects from users to ensure there are sufficient power supplies =
in the future.
>=20
> The Cambridge organizers said the first phase of their efforts will =
take five to seven years and will target about half of the 23,000 =
buildings in the city. The goal in that period is to reduce overall =
electricity use by 10 percent, and during peak hours -- roughly 4 to 7 =
p.m. daily -- by 14 percent. The average household in Cambridge uses =
about 4,500 kilowatt hours of electricity a year, costing about $800, =
according to city officials.
>=20
> The energy specialists who helped organize the effort believe that by =
reducing consumption within buildings they will also be reducing the =
emissions that contribute to global warming. If Cambridge meets its =
goals, the energy specialists said, it will have reduced annual =
emissions of carbon dioxide by 150,000 tons.
>=20
> "Seventy percent of emissions come from buildings," said Robert L. =
Pratt, senior vice president of the Henry P. Kendall Foundation, which =
focuses on environmental matters. It conceived and helped to design and =
pay for the program.
>=20
> Most of Cambridge's buildings are residential, with around 2,400 =
others owned by universities and other nonprofits, commercial and =
industrial landlords, and governments.
>=20
> Cambridge officials expect the greatest and quickest savings will come =
from working with universities and large commercial and industrial =
properties, which collectively account for 69 percent of the city's =
energy consumption. Ultimately, proponents hope that all residential =
property owners will agree to undertake the recommended improvements.
>=20
> Participation is voluntary, but a significant element of the project =
is a campaign to build public enthusiasm, to create peer pressure to get =
more property owners involved.
>=20
> The nonprofit organization, the Cambridge Energy Alliance, will hire =
energy consultants to work with property owners to determine how to make =
their buildings more efficient. Improvements could be as simple as =
beefing up insulation or adding storm windows, or something as expensive =
as installing a high-efficiency cogeneration system at a large property, =
which generates electricity and throws off heat to warm rooms in winter.
>=20
> The nonprofit will administer the program, issue loans, and track and =
certify reductions in energy use. Although many financing details have =
yet to be worked out, building owners are supposed to repay the loans =
using the savings from reduced energy costs.
>=20
> For example, proponents said a typical homeowner who gets a $1,100 =
loan to add insulation and buy a more efficient air- conditioner could =
reduce annual energy bills by around $250, meaning the payoff period can =
be four to five years.
>=20
> Initially, property owners will be allowed to pocket about one- third =
of the energy savings from these measures, the consultants said, using =
the balance to repay their loans. Once the loans are fully repaid, the =
property owner would reap all future savings.
>=20
> Cambridge officials and consultants are trying to work out an =
arrangement with electricity provider NStar, a partner in the program, =
to allow electricity users to repay the loans through a charge on their =
regular monthly bills.
>=20
> "This is an excellent project and could become the energy model of the =
future," said Tom May, NStar's chief executive.
>=20
> Art Rosenfeld, a physicist and member of the California Energy =
Commission who was one of the nation's first experts on saving energy, =
said the comprehensive nature of the Cambridge project exceeds most =
initiatives under way in California, considered a leader in such =
programs. "You're ahead of us," he said.
>=20
> Such large-scale municipal energy efficiency efforts are spreading. =
Foy said he is working with New York City officials to design a program =
similar to Cambridge's. And state officials are starting a $2 million =
fund this year to begin energy efficiency programs in Boston and four =
other Massachusetts cities that have not yet been selected.

> Full text:
> With large numbers of homeowners falling behind on mortgage payments, =
lenders across the country are seeking creative ways to keep delinquent =
customers out of foreclosure.
>=20
> One of the newest approaches: the "Mod Squad," a roving 50- member =
team of problem-solvers who work for Texas-based EMC Mortgage, a =
subsidiary of Wall Street investment bank Bear Stearns. EMC services =
approximately 500,000 loans nationwide, with $78 billion in outstanding =
balances.
>=20
> Named for a hit TV series from the late 1960s and early '70s, the Mod =
Squad consists of experts in loan modifications -- custom workout =
solutions for borrowers who no longer can afford their mortgages. The =
object is to search for changes in rates and terms that will permit the =
borrowers to remain in their houses, pay down their loans and avoid =
foreclosure.
>=20
> "Foreclosing doesn't benefit anyone -- not the borrower, not the =
lender, not the bond holder," EMC President and CEO John Vella said in =
an interview. On the other hand, recasting certain terms of the mortgage =
-- lowering monthly payments for a period, deferring unpaid principal =
and interest or changing the rate -- may allow delinquent borrowers to =
get past whatever financial issues caused them to fall behind.
>=20
> What's unusual about the Mod Squad is that rather than waiting for =
homeowners to contact EMC when they get in a jam, the team reaches out =
to individual borrowers, working with local consumer and credit =
counseling organizations and holding loan modification educational =
meetings for borrowers in cities where delinquencies are rising.
>=20
> Loan modification is just one approach mortgage servicers can use to =
stem the tide of foreclosures. Other techniques include:
>=20
> *Repayment plans where balances are reduced over time through small, =
regular add-ons to borrowers' monthly payments.
>=20
> *Forbearance agreements whereby principal and interest payments are =
reduced or suspended for a time, enabling the borrowers to get their =
finances under control. Then the regular payments resume, along with =
gradual reimbursements of balances in arrears.
>=20
> Remedies such as these are more common than many credit-strapped =
homeowners may be aware. In fact, major mortgage institutions such as =
Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and the Federal Housing Administration require =
loan servicing companies to offer one or more plans to delinquent =
customers who have a reasonable chance of avoiding foreclosure.
>=20
> FHA even allows money to be advanced interest-free on behalf of =
delinquent homeowners to bring their loans current, up to a maximum of =
12 months worth of principal, interest, taxes and insurance. The =
mortgage company files a "partial claim" with FHA to obtain the funds =
needed to pay all arrears. The borrowers are expected to repay =
everything they owe at the end of the loan term or from the proceeds =
when they sell their home.
>=20
> Variations on that may be the next development in foreclosure- =
prevention.
>=20
> Many buyers in the last several years made no down payments and bought =
costlier properties than they could afford. Some now face massive =
monthly payment boosts and negative equity situations.
>=20
> They can't afford their mortgages, nor can they afford to refinance =
because they owe more than their house is worth.
>=20
> Leaders in the House and Senate have urged private lenders, Wall =
Street, Fannie, Freddie and the federal government to devise programs to =
help thousands of boom-era buyers who face foreclosure this year or =
next.
>=20
> One option that is gaining significant attention has been advanced by =
a Virginia-based loss-mitigation firm, Lyons McCloskey LLC. Borrowers in =
serious default would be refinanced into government-insured or =
guaranteed fixed-rate programs such as FHA, VA or rural housing. If =
their loan balances exceeded FHA statutory limits, the refinancings =
could be provided through Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.
>=20
> Initial balances on the new mortgages would be what the borrowers =
could afford based on their current incomes at market rates. Any =
shortfall between the amount of the new loan and the balances owed on =
the previous loan would be recast into a "soft" second lien, a second =
mortgage or deed of trust carrying a minimal or zero interest rate and =
no monthly payments.
>=20
> The second lien would be due in a lump sum at any sale of the property =
or whenever the borrowers could afford to retire the debt.
>=20
> Credit risks on the soft second mortgage would be shared by Wall =
Street bond investors, the federal government or other mortgage market =
players.
>=20
> The concept wouldn't keep everybody out of foreclosure, nor would it =
be extended to people who inflated their incomes or recklessly bought =
properties they could not afford.
>=20
> But it could be one answer for payment-shocked subprime borrowers who =
simply got in over their heads and mistimed the end of the boom.

35-year-old Richton Park woman shot five times by her estranged husband sai=
d she had an order of protection against him and complained to police three=
 weeks ago that he was harassing her, but nothing was done.</p><p class=3D"=
">   Police said the order of protection had expired and that detectives as=
ked Clarence Banks to come talk to them after the complaint, but he did not=
.</p><p class=3D"">   Banks, 37, shot his wife Thursday and then turned the=
 gun on himself, Richton Park Acting Police Chief Vito Mannino said.  Banks=
 died a few hours later. His wife, whose name police would not release, sur=
vived and was hospitalized.</p><p class=3D"">   A sister, LaMonica Sims, sa=
id the woman's condition was improving and she was surrounded by friends an=

ave prevented the shooting.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;My problem is why did=
n't the police go pick him up,&quot; she said. Mannino said the woman repor=
ted an incident involving her husband about three weeks ago and that Banks =
was under investigation. &quot;We'd asked him to come in and talk to a dete=
ctive,&quot; he said. &quot;But either we postponed it or he did.&quot;</p>=
<p class=3D"">   Mannino said officers told the woman not to stay at her ho=
me, but she didn't follow their advice.</p><p class=3D"">   Police were cal=
led to the scene by residents in the Lioncrest Townhouse complex near 219th=
 Street and Governors Highway. When police arrived, they found Banks lying =
on the ground and his wife was about 20 yards away, Mannino said. A .32-cal=
iber semiautomatic handgun and numerous shell casings were recovered from t=
he scene.</p><p class=3D"">   The couple had been married  about 10 years, =
Sims said, but they separated about six months ago. Her sister moved into h=

wn in the residential housing market, Chicago-based Corus Bankshares Inc. s=
aid Friday that first-quarter net income dropped 39 percent and warned that=
 the situation could worsen &quot;over the next several quarters, or even y=
ears,&quot; particularly if problems persist in the subprime lending market=
.</p><p class=3D"">   Shares of the company, one of the area's biggest loca=
lly based banks, tumbled as much as 8 percent before rallying to close at $=
17.27, down 0.23 percent, on the Nasdaq stock market.</p><p class=3D"">   &=
quot;With a loan portfolio consisting, almost exclusively, of condominium c=
onstruction and conversion loans, the nationwide slowdown in the residentia=
l housing market is impacting Corus' business,&quot; Chief Executive Robert=
 Glickman said in a statement.</p><p class=3D"">   The slowdown is manifest=
ing itself through a decline in loan originations and therefore loans outst=
anding, as well as an increase in problem loans.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;=
The current quarter's earnings declined as a result, and it would not surpr=
ise us to see an even greater impact on earnings over the next several quar=
ters, or even years, depending on when the market improves,&quot; Glickman =
said.</p><p class=3D"">   The parent of Corus Bank said it's unclear what e=
ffect problems in the subprime mortgage lending market, which serves consum=
ers with spotty credit, will have on the company. It doesn't make, purchase=
 or hold any subprime mortgages, but there could be an indirect impact beca=
use its customers are the condo developers who sell units to individuals.</=
p><p class=3D"">   To the extent that subprime lenders cut back on their lo=
ans, &quot;it is likely that our customers [the condo developers] may lose =
sales to those individuals who would have required a subprime mortgage to c=
lose on their purchase,&quot; Glickman said.</p><p class=3D"">   Among the =
Chicago market's top 10 bank holding companies as ranked by deposit market =
share, Corus is one of only four locally headquartered companies. The other=
s are Northern Trust Corp., Wintrust Financial Corp. and First Midwest Banc=
orp.</p><p class=3D"">   JPMorgan Chase, LaSalle Bank, Harris Bank, Fifth T=
hird, Charter One and Citibank are all owned by out-of-town companies.</p><=
p class=3D"">   Corus said earnings fell to $26.4 million, or 46 cents a sh=
are, from $43.4 million, or 75 cents a share, in the first quarter of 2006.=
 The latest results included a pre-tax loss of $15.3 million related to the=
 decline in value of a stock investment.</p><p class=3D"">   Excluding that=
, earnings would have been $36.3 million, or 63 cents a share, still a 17 p=
ercent decline from the year-ago quarter.</p><p class=3D"">   ----------</p=

>   For five of the past six years, Bangladesh's people have ranked their n=
ation the most corrupt on Earth on an international graft watchdog list. It=
 isn't hard to see why.</p><p class=3D"">   Economists estimate that thievi=
ng politicians, including the families and cronies of the country's two feu=
ding political dynasties, have pocketed more than $5 billion a year by taki=
ng a cut of nearly everything sold in the country. About $40 billion in for=
eign aid has been misappropriated over 35 years in this poor and densely po=
pulated delta nation, analysts say.</p><p class=3D"">   In Bangladesh, judg=
es throw cases for cash, bureaucrats sell jobs, businessmen run strong-arm =
cartels and, until recently, outgoing Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's eldest s=
on, Tarique Rahman, was known as &quot;Mr. Ten Percent&quot; for his rapaci=
ous skimming.</p><p class=3D"">   But this month, Mr. Ten Percent is in jai=
led awaiting trial, along with a few dozen of the country's other top polit=
icians. His powerful mother is expected to head to exile in Saudi Arabia wi=
thin days, rather than face corruption charges. And her longtime political =
rival, Sheikh Hasina, has been told that if she returns Monday as planned f=
rom an extended holiday abroad, she faces prosecution on corruption and mur=
der charges.</p><p class=3D"">   In surely one of the strangest political t=
urnarounds in the world, this South Asian kleptocracy now finds itself run =
by a military-backed government took power three months ago intent on resto=
ring democracy by prosecuting or exiling the nation's most powerful politic=
ians as part of an unprecedented war on corruption.</p><p class=3D"">   Tha=
t the top two targets are women -- usually seen in aid circles as the less =
corruptible sex -- only adds to the oddness of the whole affair.</p><p clas=
s=3D"">   &quot;It's definitely surreal,&quot; said Iftekhar Zaman, executi=
ve director of the Bangladesh branch of Transparency International, the lea=
ding international anti-corruption watchdog that releases corruption rankin=
gs each year. &quot;But this country was left with no options.&quot;</p><p =
class=3D"">   'Unprecedented' turnaround</p><p class=3D"">   In January, Ba=
ngladesh's military declared a state of emergency in the moderate Muslim na=
tion and installed a caretaker government after efforts to hold elections f=
ailed following violent street protests between supporters of the two polit=
ical parties that for 15 years have battled for Bangladesh's political spoi=
ls.</p><p class=3D"">   Since then, with enthusiastic backing from the coun=
try's fed-up population of 140 million, Bangladesh's new rulers have launch=
ed a campaign to root out political corruption as a prerequisite for holdin=
g new democratic elections next year.</p><p class=3D"">   Poor, crowded and=
 set on a vast flood-prone delta, Bangladesh is best-known for huge death t=
olls from seasonal cyclones and monsoons. But in recent decades the Iowa-si=
zed country of rice paddies and shrimp farms has emerged as a perfect cauld=
ron for graft as plundering politicians, greedy bureaucrats, bribe-profferi=
ng businessmen and the least savory of the nation's many non-profit aid gro=
ups look for a way to make an unearned buck, sometimes by tapping into bill=
ions in aid money passing through each year.</p><p class=3D"">   The new go=
vernment says it now hopes to change that. After years of foot-dragging, th=
e country signed a United Nations anti- corruption charter that will help i=
ts leaders recover illicit funds stashed abroad. It has reinvigorated an in=
effective anti-graft commission, demanded financial statements from top pol=
iticians and is strengthening laws barring politicians convicted of corrupt=
ion from office.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;There's never been an example of=
 this kind of turnaround. This is unprecedented,&quot; said Zaman, whose or=
ganization finds itself in the odd position of consulting closely with an u=
nelected, military- supported government to promote democracy. &quot;It's n=
ot the process we wanted. We wanted this done by political leadership. But =
since they miserably failed to deliver, it has come to this.&quot;</p><p cl=
ass=3D"">   Turning around Bangladesh's culture of political corruption wil=
l not be easy. Most of the investigators charged with tracking down the rea=
l estate records, bank statements and other documents needed to prosecute t=
hose now jailed have never done the work before and may be a little anxious=
 about trying to put their former, and potentially future, bosses in prison=
.</p><p class=3D"">   Those arrested have powerful friends and the money to=
 hire the best lawyers in the country, and the country's prosecutors have n=
ever prosecuted corruption cases before. In some cases, caretaker officials=
 may be faced with having to prosecute colleagues, friends and neighbors.</=
p><p class=3D"">   In a country where court cases typically drag on for dec=
ades, the government has limited trials to 60 days, with adjournments -- a =
favored stalling tactic -- limited to three days. It has also hired private=
 attorneys as prosecutors and dangled offers of incentive pay for investiga=
tors who find evidence that helps win convictions.</p><p class=3D"">   But =
with limited resources &quot;we're going mad trying to investigate all thes=
e high-profile cases at once,&quot; admitted Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury, chair=
man of the country's new independent Anti- Corruption Commission.</p><p cla=
ss=3D"">   The fear, said Ataur Rahman, a political corruption expert at th=
e University of Dhaka, is that &quot;if you can't get convictions, the mess=
age will be that nothing has changed.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   The anti-co=
rruption commission and caretaker government also are trying to revamp key =
institutions, from removing executive influence in the judiciary to rebuild=
ing the electoral commission, in an effort to stifle future pilferers.</p><=
p class=3D"">   One of the keys, officials agree, is making sure Bangladesh=
's two political leading ladies exit politics for good. To that end, the go=
vernment is willing to let them, and perhaps their families, avoid prosecut=
ion as long as they agree to leave Bangladesh permanently.</p><p class=3D""=
>   Both face corruption charges, and Hasina faces murder charges as a resu=
lt of deaths in street riots she is said to have helped provoke last Octobe=
r.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;For the sake of stability, we are anxious they=
 have an honorable exit,&quot; said Mainul Hossein, the caretaker governmen=
t's key law and justice official, and one of 10 technocrats running the cou=
ntry.  So far, the effort has enjoyed widespread support in a country where=
 the military is seen as one of the most trustworthy institutions and corru=
ption has been largely the domain of the rich and powerful, rather than rea=
ching throughout society.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;This government needs t=
o stay as long as it can manage the country corruption-free,&quot; added Sh=
adak Hossain, 30, an appliance store owner. &quot;No other government can s=
ucceed against corruption.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Military's lead worrie=
s some</p><p class=3D"">   Since the corruption crackdown, sales of his exp=
ensive refrigerators, air conditioners and other appliances had plunged 40 =
percent, he said, largely because &quot;people are afraid of being noticed =
and investigated for spending lots of money.&quot; But his cost of buying g=
oods had also dropped 20 percent, he said, now that the corrupt cartel that=
 used to control wholesale distribution has gone into hiding.</p><p class=
=3D"">   Bangladeshis remember well how neighboring Pakistan's military- le=
d anti-corruption drive ended with the military entrenched in power. Alread=
y a few are calling for new elections before the government-set deadline of=
 the end of 2008, and many in civil society worry that &quot;it's easy to b=
ring [the military] into politics and hard to push them back,&quot; Zaman s=
aid.</p><p class=3D"">   Mainul Hossain, the law and justice official, insi=
sted that the government knows its time is limited and that it is focused o=
n creating conditions for new elections. Small-scale political gatherings, =
now banned under the state of emergency, will be legalized again within a m=
onth or so, he said. The government hopes new, better political leaders wil=
l rise from the ranks of the old parties, or that new ones will form, and t=
hat by the time elections are next called, anti-corruption reforms will hav=
e taken root.</p><p class=3D"">   The real test for Bangladesh's democracy =
may well come if they have not.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;Any transition is=
 fraught with risks. There are many ifs, ands and buts before the end of th=
e story,&quot; Zaman said. &quot;But with the changes we have seen in the l=
ast three months, there are reasons to be optimistic.&quot;</p><p class=3D"=

   This was not supposed to be such a good moment for the stock market.</p>=
<p class=3D"">   Corporate earnings still are expected to look weaker this =
year, and fears of a meltdown in the subprime lending market have loomed. T=
he dollar has been eroding against major currencies, and the overall outloo=
k for the U.S. economy has been hazy.</p><p class=3D"">   But as spring has=
 sprung, everything on Wall Street has unexpectedly come up roses.</p><p cl=
ass=3D"">   The Dow Jones industrial average broke a record for the third d=
ay in a row Friday, with the benchmark index hurtling ahead 153.35 points, =
or 1.2 percent, to 12,961.98.</p><p class=3D"">   It was the seventh winnin=
g day in a row and a nearly 350-point gain for the week, putting the  index=
 within striking distance of the psychologically significant 13,000-point b=
arrier earlier in the year than even optimists had anticipated.</p><p class=
=3D"">   Of course, markets can reverse course quickly, and analysts alread=
y were looking ahead to the possibility of a correction next week, but what=
 was striking on Friday was how strong the fundamentals look, particularly =
for American corporations.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;We have had very good =
readings on both employment and spending in the U.S.,&quot; said Carl Tanne=
nbaum, chief economist at LaSalle Bank. &quot;Foreign economies are outperf=
orming expectations and improving sales of U.S. products overseas. Those tr=
ends are flowing to corporate bottom lines. Our forecast is this is going t=
o be a very good year.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Among the blue-chips repor=
ting first-quarter earnings this week, 10 of 16 Dow components posted finan=
cial results that surpassed analyst forecasts, The Associated Press said.</=
p><p class=3D"">   Those better-than-expected operating results, plus a gen=
eral decline in shares outstanding, spurred analysts to boost estimates for=
 first-quarter earnings-per-share growth at S&amp;P 500 companies to 6.2 pe=
rcent from last week's 3.1 percent, according to Bloomberg data.</p><p clas=
s=3D"">   One of those surprise companies pushing the Dow higher Friday was=
 Caterpillar Inc., the Peoria-based equipment giant, which closed up $3.20,=
 at $71.82. The company said &quot;exceptional growth&quot; in foreign mark=
ets helped offset weak results in key U.S. sectors.</p><p class=3D"">   &qu=
ot;Earnings have come through as expected or better than expected,&quot; Pe=
ter Brodie, director of investments at Bryn Mawr Trust Co., said about the =
stock market in general.</p><p class=3D"">   At the close of trading Friday=
, virtually every sector of the American stock market was up. The S&amp;P 5=
00 was up 13.62, to close at 1484.35, up 4.66 percent for the year, and Nas=
daq rose 21.04, to close at 2526.39, up 4.6 percent for the year.</p><p cla=
ss=3D"">   Of the 47 market subsectors followed by Bloomberg, ranging from =
oil service companies to middle-size companies to the entire New York Stock=
 Exchange, not one ended lower Friday.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;It's not a=
 matter of 13,000 for the Dow; we could be looking at 14,000 by the end of =
the year,&quot; Robert Froehlich, chief investment strategist for investmen=
t firm DWS Scudder, told the AP. &quot;There's too much money out there cha=
sing too few companies. This story isn't ending anytime soon.&quot;</p><p c=
lass=3D"">   Certainly, that highly optimistic prediction wasn't held by al=
l market observers.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;If there was a correction nex=
t week, we wouldn't be surprised,&quot; said Brodie, though adding that the=
 wise investor will ignore such ups and downs and allocate assets according=
 to a plan.</p><p class=3D"">   Still, there was plenty to reassure investo=
rs.</p><p class=3D"">   For weeks there has been concern that the rising de=
fault rate on subprime mortgages would infect financial markets. Subprime m=
ortgages are loans made to home buyers with questionable credit and ability=
 to repay the money.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;The real concern was that it=
 was going to spread into other areas of credit,&quot; said Michael Church,=
 portfolio manager of Church Capital Management. &quot;That hasn't happened=
 yet.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Church said a credit scare still could hurt=
 small companies with big holdings of subprime mortgages, but won't much hu=
rt big, diversified financial houses.</p><p class=3D"">   Stanley Nabi, who=
 helps oversee about $8 billion at Silvercrest Asset Management in New York=
, told Bloomberg that &quot;pessimism over the outlook for earnings is begi=
nning to ease as you see profits from companies like Caterpillar growing.&q=
uot;</p><p class=3D"">   As for the future, &quot;The market should rally f=
urther,&quot; Nabi said.</p><p class=3D"">   ----------</p><p class=3D"">  =

p><div class=3D""><p class=3D"">   Dear Abby: Twenty years ago, my sister a=
nd I bought a business from our mother. We all love and respect one another=
 and get along well. We will be finished paying off the business in two yea=
rs.</p><p class=3D"">   Our problem: Mom, who is now 77, still draws a sala=
ry from us above and beyond the payment for the business. Her workload has =
lessened greatly, as it should. She could do all of her work in one day and=
 lessen the burden of her salary. However, she says she'd &quot;go crazy&qu=
ot; if she retired. We don't want that. She could still come in as often as=
 she wants and do her personal paperwork, banking, letter- writing, reading=
, etc. These are all things she does at &quot;work&quot; -- on the clock.</=
p><p class=3D"">   If we try to discuss this, Mom gets hurt and says, &quot=
;Just let me know when I'm not worth the money.&quot; We don't want to do t=
hat. We would hope she would see the fairness of this and suggest it hersel=
f.</p><p class=3D"">   Business expenses are going through the roof, and th=
ere are updates we should make, but we can't do it as long as we are paying=
 Mom at the level we are, on top of the money for the buyout.</p><p class=
=3D"">   -- Daughters Dearest</p><p class=3D"">   Dear Daughters: You do, i=
ndeed, have a problem. It's one that should be handled with the utmost dipl=
omacy.</p><p class=3D"">   Because your mother is an intelligent businesswo=
man, she must be a part of this decision. Schedule a business meeting betwe=
en the three of you and put the budget on the table for discussion -- along=
 with the updates that need to be made. Ideally, she will recognize the dil=
emma and suggest the cutback herself.</p><p class=3D"">   If your mother fa=
ils to reduce her salary for the good of the company, begin &quot;planting =
seeds&quot; about how nice it would be to have time to devote to charity an=
d how much she has to offer volunteerism. (It's the truth.) Research volunt=
eer opportunities in your area, and perhaps even talk to some volunteer org=
anizations about recruiting your mother. When she realizes how interesting =
and fulfilling these activities can be, encourage her to reduce her hours a=
t work to enable her to contribute to the community. Good luck.</p><p class=
=3D"">   Dear Abby: My mother-in-law is coming soon for her annual two- wee=
k visit, and my nightmares about it have already begun. She is 78 years you=
ng, sweet and non-judgmental. The problem is, she talks non- stop about peo=
ple we have never met.</p><p class=3D"">   When we introduce her to friends=
, she continues story after story about people who are of interest only to =
her.</p><p class=3D"">   My mother-in-law lives alone. So do a lot of peopl=
e, including my own mother, but no one talks as incessantly as she does. Wh=
y does she do this, and what can I do? Help!</p><p class=3D"">   -- Talked =
To Death in Eugene, Ore.</p><p class=3D"">   Dear Talked To Death: Compulsi=
ve talking can be a nervous habit, a sign of insecurity or an attempt to co=
ntrol. In your mother-in- law's case, it could also be because for two week=
s a year, she has someone to talk to.</p><p class=3D"">   Because her visit=
s are so stressful, ask your doctor for advice on how to alleviate the stre=
ss.</p><p class=3D"">   ----------</p><p class=3D"">   Dear Abby is written=

ances by U.S. and Macau officials, North Korea said Friday that it is still=
 negotiating over possession of $25 million in North Korean accounts frozen=
 by Macau banking authorities for the past 21 months.</p><p class=3D"">   T=
he complicated financial dispute, although U.S. officials have repeatedly d=
eclared it resolved, has persisted in preventing implementation of an agree=
ment Feb. 13 under which North Korea pledged to close its main nuclear reac=
tor and allow verification by inspectors from the International Atomic Ener=
gy Agency.</p><p class=3D"">   That accord was hailed as a breakthrough in =
nearly four years of on-again, off-again multinational talks aimed at disma=
ntling North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Under its terms, the U.S. Tre=
asury was to have the blocked funds freed within 30 days and North Korea wa=
s to stop operations at the Yongbyon reactor within 60 days. But both deadl=
ines were missed, leaving the six-nation talks stalled yet again.</p><p cla=
ss=3D"">   After prolonged negotiations among U.S., Chinese, Macau and Nort=
h Korean banking officials, the U.S. Treasury announced April 10 that Macau=
's Monetary Authority was ready to release the disputed money. On the stren=
gth of that announcement, the chief U.S. negotiator, Assistant Secretary of=
 State Christopher Hill,  said North Korea had no further reason not to hon=
or its pledge to shut down the reactor.</p><p class=3D"">   But the officia=
l Korean Central News Agency on Friday released a letter from Ri Je Son, he=
ad of the North Korean Department of Atomic Energy,  saying &quot;brisk&quo=
t; negotiations are still under way on what to do about the money.</p><p cl=
ass=3D"">   Through a spokeswoman, Wendy Au, the Monetary Authority of Maca=
u  refused to explain why North Korea would say talks are still going on 10=
 days after the U.S. Treasury and the monetary authority announced the mone=
y was ready for transfer.</p><p class=3D"">   In his letter, Ri did not des=
cribe what the negotiations are about. Colin McAskill,  a British banker, h=
as claimed $7 million of the total represents legitimate earnings from trad=
e with North Korea and should remain in accounts held by his Daedong Credit=
 Bank.  Japanese press reports have said a portion of the money has been tr=
ansferred to North Korea while some of it remains in dispute.</p><p class=
=3D"">   North Korea &quot;remains unchanged in its will to implement the F=
eb. 13 agreement,&quot; Ri said in the letter. &quot;But what matters is th=
at it cannot move as the issue of frozen funds has not yet been completely =
settled.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Ri's letter, addressed to Mohamed ElBara=
dei, head of the IAEA, was seen as an expression of continued goodwill desp=
ite the missed deadlines. In it, Ri repeated assurances that North Korea wi=
ll invite IAEA inspectors into North Korea to supervise the Yongbyon reacto=
r's closing &quot;the moment the actual unfreezing of the frozen fund in th=
e bank has been confirmed.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   The Macau Monetary Aut=
hority blocked the money after the U.S. Treasury alleged in September 2005 =
that a number of accounts in the Macau-based Banco Delta Asia  were being u=
sed to launder illicit North Korean earnings. In response, North Korea boyc=
otted the six- nation nuclear negotiations for more than a year.</p><p clas=
s=3D"">   With Hill's pledge that the issue would be resolved, North Korea =
returned to the talks.</p><p class=3D""> Credit: By Edward Cody, The Washin=

e did use weren't minced, his son said.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;He was ol=
d school all the way,&quot; Craig MacLeod said about his father, a retired =
vice president of Harris Bank and the great- grandson of Norman Wait Harris=
, the bank's founder. &quot;He didn't say an awful lot, but he was always h=
onest and always down to earth.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   MacLeod, 90, of H=
ighland Park, died of natural causes on Sunday, April 15, in his home.</p><=
p class=3D"">   He was known for being direct, his family said, and it was =
while serving as chairman of the board of trustees for the Young Women's Ch=
ristian Association of Chicago that Mr. MacLeod often displayed the trait.<=
/p><p class=3D"">   Once, his family recalled, while calling on a potential=
 donor, Mr. MacLeod was told that the company had already given to the YMCA=
 that year. Unfazed, he responded: &quot;Then it's time for the girls.&quot=
;</p><p class=3D"">   He left with a similar donation.</p><p class=3D"">   =
Born in 1917 on Chicago's South Side, Mr. MacLeod spent his youth in Southe=
rn California, where he attended Pomona College, a school to which he remai=
ned devoted.</p><p class=3D"">   During his time on the Claremont campus, M=
r. MacLeod was engaged in a number of activities, Pomona spokesman Don Patt=
ison said. Those endeavors included serving as president of his fraternity =
and the inter-fraternity council, lettering on the school's swim team and t=
aking photos for the yearbook.</p><p class=3D"">   In 1939, Mr. MacLeod gra=
duated from Pomona with a degree in economics and joined the school's board=
 of trustees in 1963. After college, Mr. MacLeod served in the U.S. Navy Su=
pply Corps during World War II, eventually earning the rank of lieutenant c=
ommander, his family said.</p><p class=3D"">   After the war, he returned t=
o the Chicago area and took a job with Harris Bank, eventually becoming a v=
ice president.</p><p class=3D"">   In the early 1970s, Mr. MacLeod moved fr=
om Winnetka to Highland Park, where he was a city councilman from 1983 to 1=
991. He helped establish the Highland Park Community Foundation, which fina=
ncially supports local organizations.</p><p class=3D"">   In 2006, Mr. MacL=
eod received the foundation's first Distinguished Citizen Award, his family=
 said.</p><p class=3D"">   Also known for his interest in gardening and ski=
ing -- a sport he didn't give up until he turned 80 -- Mr. MacLeod loved no=
thing more than his family and wife of 37 years, Martha.</p><p class=3D""> =
  &quot;He was a very big family man and had quite a large family, with son=
s and daughters and stepsons and stepdaughters,&quot; Craig MacLeod said. &=
quot;He also was absolutely devoted to his wife. You couldn't separate them=
, and she was his biggest concern when he was stuck in the hospital.</p><p =
class=3D"">   &quot;I don't know a lot of couples who were as tight as they=
 were.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   In addition to his wife and son, Mr. MacLe=

esentatives on Friday approved a measure to give shareholders more say on h=
ow companies pay top executives, rejecting amendments by Republicans who sa=
id corporate boards already have enough power to set compensation.</p><p cl=
ass=3D"">   The measure, approved 269-134, aims to rein in pay levels that =
House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank and other top Demo=
crats called excessive by giving public-company shareholders annual non-bin=
ding votes on executive salaries.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;There are, unfo=
rtunately, a lot of examples of excessive compensation for CEOs,&quot; Fran=
k said after the vote. &quot;It bites into other things that you would use =
the money for.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, h=
as made tackling exorbitant executive compensation a top priority since tak=
ing over as chairman in January. He criticized the severance package awarde=
d to former Home Depot Inc. Chief Executive Robert Nardelli in January as a=
 &quot;$210 million goodbye kiss.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   There isn't a u=
niform, legal right for shareholders to vote on pay packages, Frank said. T=
he legislation &quot;will strengthen the hands of those in the corporate wo=
rld who have been trying to slow this down,&quot; he said.</p><p class=3D""=
>   The measure next goes to the Senate, where Sen. Barack Obama, an Illino=
is Democrat running for president, introduced legislation identical to Fran=
k's bill on Friday.</p><p class=3D"">   Frank said he hasn't discussed the =
measure with his counterpart, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher=
 Dodd (D-Conn.). The panel hasn't held hearings.</p><p class=3D"">   Invest=
or advocates have pressed companies to allow shareholders to vote on pay, w=
hich they say has gotten out of hand. Median pay for CEOs of U.S. companies=
 rose 9.3 percent, to $2 million, in 2006, according to the Corporate Libra=
ry, a corporate-governance research firm-based in Portland, Maine.</p><p cl=
ass=3D"">   Republicans said the proposal would steer talented executives t=
o private companies, drive companies to list on overseas exchanges and empo=
wer &quot;activist&quot; investors who have their own agendas unrelated to =
the best interests of the company. Shareholders already have the right to p=
ropose a vote on executive pay, they said.</p><p class=3D"">   The House re=
jected seven Republican amendments. One, by Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, woul=
d have allowed public companies to forgo the vote if the Securities and Exc=
hange Commission concluded that it hindered their ability to compete for th=
e best executives.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;I'm all in favor of a sharehol=
der vote, if it's done without a mandate from Washington,&quot; Price said.=
</p><p class=3D"">   Another Republican amendment, introduced by Rep. Scott=
 Garrett of New Jersey, would have allowed shareholder votes only if execut=
ive pay at the company was 10 percent or more than the average pay at compa=
nies in the same industry.</p><p class=3D"">   If the bill becomes law, it'=
s not clear it will have an impact. At annual meetings so far this year, sh=
areholders have rejected non- binding votes on executive compensation at Mo=
rgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc., United Technologies Corp., U.S. Bancorp, Wach=
ovia Corp. and Coca-Cola Co.</p><p class=3D""> Credit: Bloomberg News</p>  =

.P. =3D Michael Phillips; M.W. =3D Michael Wilmington.</p><p class=3D"">   =
300</p><p class=3D"">   1/2: A fairly entertaining bloodbath designed to pu=
t audiences ringside in the 5th Century B.C. as the Spartans square off aga=
inst the Persians. It's the few against the many, and the few are mighty fi=
t. R. 1:57. -- M.P.</p><p class=3D"">   Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie =
Film for Theaters</p><p class=3D"">   1/2: The cult cartoon goes big screen=
 with the absurd adventures of fast-food pals -- a box of fries, a milkshak=
e and a wad of meat. Hilarious for 20 minutes, but soon, even fans realize =
that junk food makes a great snack, but an awful diet. R. 1:27. -- Eric Gwi=
nn</p><p class=3D"">   Are We Done Yet?</p><p class=3D"">   1/2: Ice Cube a=
nd Nia Long got together in 2005's &quot;Are We There Yet?&quot; -- now twi=
ns are on the way. Time to buy a fixer-upper, blueprints provided by 1948's=
 &quot;Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House.&quot; PG. 1:32. -- M.P.</p><p =
class=3D"">   Black Book</p><p class=3D"">   1/2: Paul Verhoeven's epic of =
the World War II Dutch resistance and an improbable affair between a Jewish=
 spy (Carice van Houten) and a Gestapo chief (Sebastian Koch) -- is fast an=
d entertaining. In several languages, with English subtitles. R. 2:25. -- M=
.W.</p><p class=3D"">   Blades of Glory</p><p class=3D"">   : Will Ferrell =
plays a maverick ice supergod; Jon &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; Heder play=
s his more balletic and willowy rival, who becomes his guy/guy skating part=
ner, initially against both boy- men's wishes. PG-13. 1:33. -- M.P.</p><p c=
lass=3D"">   Disturbia</p><p class=3D"">   : In this teen-slanted rehash of=
 plot from Alfred Hitchcock's &quot;Rear Window,&quot; Shia LaBeouf plays a=
 suburban kid under house arrest who suspects his next-door neighbor (David=
 Morse) is a serial killer. PG-13. 1:44. -- M.W.</p><p class=3D"">   Fireho=
use Dog</p><p class=3D"">   : Presumed dead, a Hollywood canine is mistaken=
 for a stray and adopted by a sullen 12-year-old (Josh Hutcherson), with an=
 arson- investigating father (Bruce Greenwood). While the ad campaign sugge=
sts wacky antics, a surprisingly well-acted father/son relationship develop=
s. PG. 1:51. -- M.P.</p><p class=3D"">   First Snow</p><p class=3D"">   : A=
 smart, tense modern film noir about a cocky young hustler (Guy Pearce) sud=
denly face to face with his failings and the mortality that a fortune telle=
r says will come in the first snows of winter. The movie has a marvelously =
crisp and uneasy mood. R. 1:41. - - M.W.</p><p class=3D"">   Grindhouse ('P=
lanet Terror'</p><p class=3D"">   and 'Death Proof'</p><p class=3D"">   1/2=
): Faux '70s schlock with real energy in this expansively scuzzy three-hour=
 double bill. Robert Rodriguez's &quot;Planet Terror&quot; presents a flesh=
-eating zombie attack; in Quentin Tarantino's &quot;Death Proof,&quot; Kurt=
 Russell plays a psychopath who earns his back-roads comeuppance. R. 3:11. =
-- M.P.</p><p class=3D"">   The Hoax</p><p class=3D"">   : How did con arti=
st/writer Clifford Irving (Richard Gere), who never met Howard Hughes, thin=
k he could get away with pretending he was the go-between for the billionai=
re's &quot;memoirs,&quot; a manuscript Irving had written himself? The 1971=
 scam is re-created in director Lasse Hallstrom's fairly engrossing dramati=
c movie. R. 1:56. -- M.W.</p><p class=3D"">   The Host</p><p class=3D"">   =
1/2: Chemical-dumping leads to serious mutant trouble. The first attack of =
the giant squid-lizard is a pip, masterly in its mix of deadpan wit and sli=
my thrills. Writer-director Bong Joon-ho keeps his focus on a family's resp=
onse to the monster. R. 1:59. -- M.P.</p><p class=3D"">   I Think I Love My=
 Wife</p><p class=3D"">   1/2: Chris Rock's agreeably crass remake of the 1=
972 Rohmer film &quot;Chloe in the Afternoon.&quot; Rock grapples with the =
temptation offered by an old and wildly available friend (Kerry Washington)=
. R. 1:34. - - M.P.</p><p class=3D"">   Journey From the Fall</p><p class=
=3D"">   : After the U.S. abandons South Vietnam, a family pays for it. The=
 freedom-loving man (Long Nguyen) is brutally &quot;re-educated&quot;; his =
wife (Diem Lien), mother (Kieu Chinh) and son (Nguyen Thai Nguyen) suffer d=
uring and after their escape to America. Yet hope sustains them. In Vietnam=
ese, with English subtitles.  R. 2:15. -- Michael Esposito</p><p class=3D""=
>   The Last Mimzy</p><p class=3D"">   : A disappointing and badly retitled=
 (from &quot;Mimsy Were the Borogroves&quot;) film about contemporary child=
ren who find futuristic toys and are profoundly altered by them. The movie =
means well, but it botches a grand opportunity to update &quot;Mimsy.&quot;=
 PG. 1:38. -- M.W.</p><p class=3D"">   Lions 3D</p><p class=3D"">   : Very =
basic IMAX fare follows a lion &quot;king&quot; and his lionesses trying to=
 survive in the Kalahari. Many beautiful images and physically rattling sou=
nd -- including elephants' low-frequency rumble of dislike for lions -- pro=
bably are worth the price of admission for some. No MPAA rating. 0:40. -- M=
ichael Esposito</p><p class=3D"">   The Lookout</p><p class=3D"">   : A bra=
in-damaged night janitor in a small-town bank (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is dra=
wn into a robbery scheme by old high school associates. The grade-A cast (J=
eff Daniels, Isla Fisher and Matthew Goode) makes the most of writer-direct=
or Scott Frank's narrative. R. 1:42. -- M.P.</p><p class=3D"">   Meet the R=
obinsons</p><p class=3D"">   : A frenetic, dizzying experience that's also =
a real technical breakthrough, a 3D cartoon feature of unusual depth and pl=
asticity, about inventor kid Lewis, who travels to the future and has a bat=
tle royal with the evil Bowler Hat Guy. G. 1:32. -- M.W.</p><p class=3D""> =
  The Namesake</p><p class=3D"">   : A profound and beautiful film about an=
 Indian family, the Gangulis, who move from Calcutta to New York and experi=
ence East- West cultural clash through several decades. In English and Beng=
ali, with English subtitles. PG-13. 2:02. -- M.W.</p><p class=3D"">   Pathf=
inder</p><p class=3D"">   : A bloody adventure movie that hurls us into a 9=
th Century clash between Vikings and Native Americans led by a Viking-raise=
d-by- Indians named Ghost (Karl Urban). R. 1:28. -- M.W.</p><p class=3D""> =
  Perfect Stranger</p><p class=3D"">   : Halle Berry plays a reporter inves=
tigating a hotshot ad honcho (Bruce Willis) who may have killed her friend.=
 For an hour or so this awkwardly plotted mystery is entertaining, then it =
pratfalls into revelations that would make a cat laugh. R. 1:49. -- M.P.</p=
><p class=3D"">   Premonition</p><p class=3D"">   : Sandra Bullock plays a =
woman who doesn't know if her &quot;dream,&quot; in which her husband dies =
in a horrible car accident, is a &quot;dream&quot; or &quot;reality.&quot; =
It's like a depressive remake of &quot;Groundhog Day.&quot; PG- 13. 1:50. -=
- M.P.</p><p class=3D"">   Pride</p><p class=3D"">   : Terrence Howard resc=
ues &quot;Pride&quot; from a sea of sports-film cliches as Jim Ellis, found=
er of the Philadelphia Department of Recreation swim team. Ellis takes a jo=
b at a pool scheduled for demolition, builds his team and guides it to the =
nationals. PG. 1:44. -- M.P.</p><p class=3D"">   The Reaping</p><p class=3D=
"">   1/2: This overstuffed 10-pack plague thriller stars Hilary Swank as a=
n LSU professor who has become &quot;the foremost debunker of supposed mira=
cles.&quot; Strange doings in bayou country debunk the debunker, leading to=
 the usual CGI-larded Satan-vs.-God business. R. 1:36. -- M.P.</p><p class=
=3D"">   Reign Over Me</p><p class=3D"">   : Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle a=
re ex-college buddies. Sandler's Charlie lost it after a 9/11 family traged=
y, Cheadle's Alan is a successful dentist hitting some mid-life snags. It's=
 an actor's show with a terrific cast. R. 2:08. -- M.W.</p><p class=3D"">  =
 Shooter</p><p class=3D"">   : Feeding on cynicism about evil done in the n=
ame of freedom and oil prices, &quot;Shooter&quot; puts Mark Wahlberg, as a=
 retired Marine sniper framed in an attempt on the president, on the run --=
 then on the hunt, aided by a disgruntled FBI agent (Michael Pena). R. 2:04=
. -- M.P.</p><p class=3D"">   TMNT</p><p class=3D"">   : With a business-fr=
iendly PG for &quot;animated action violence&quot; and &quot;some scary car=
toon images&quot; -- neither of which sound scary -- you might think: bring=
 the 2-year-olds. Surprise! Besides being ugly- spirited, this Ninja Turtle=
s movie is all assaultive frenzy. PG. 1:22. -- M.P .</p>            </div><=

xt></p><div class=3D""><p class=3D"">   The Chicago Spire took another step=
 toward becoming a 2,000-foot- high reality Thursday when the Chicago Plan =
Commission recommended that its current design by famed architect Santiago =
Calatrava be approved by the city zoning committee.</p><p class=3D"">   Dur=
ing the hearing, Garrett Kelleher, chief executive of Shelbourne Developmen=
t Ltd. of Dublin, said the tower would be &quot;a unique building in a happ=
ening city.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Regarding questions about finances, K=
elleher told the commission that a top executive at the Anglo Irish Bank, h=
eadquartered in Dublin, &quot;fully supports me, and I have shown their let=
ter to the City of Chicago.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   But one high-rise dev=
eloper wonders if that would be sufficient.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;The w=
orld's tallest buildings are so expensive that they need countries or major=
 corporations to bankroll them,&quot; said Steven Fifield, chairman of the =
Fifield Cos., which has built office and residential towers in Chicago and =
elsewhere in the U.S. &quot;The Anglo Irish Bank is not big enough to be th=
e sole lending source on a project that could approach $1,000 a square foot=
 to develop.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;That just isn't credible,&quot; Fifi=
eld said.</p><p class=3D"">   Moving through the city approval process, Kel=
leher's firmwants to increase the amount of space to be built on its 2.2-ac=
re lakefront site to 25 times the lot size, rather than 10 times the lot si=
ze. That would enable Shelbourne Development to build a 2.4-million- square=
-foot tower. It also seeks permission to build exit and entry ramps linked =
to Lake Shore Drive.</p><p class=3D"">   Now that he has the Plan Commissio=
n's approval , Kelleher will ask the City Council's Zoning Committee for it=
s OK of the twisting 150-story tower's design and site plan Thursday. If he=
 clears that hurdle, he'll bring his project to the full City Council on Ma=
y 9 for the final go-ahead.</p><p class=3D"">   Prospects appear good.</p><=
p class=3D"">   &quot;This is a wonderful project, and everyone is very ent=
hused,&quot; said Constance Buscemi, spokeswoman for the city's Planning De=
partment.</p><p class=3D"">   Shelbourne also has offered to pay $9 million=
 toward the development of the nearby 3.2-acre DuSable Park. In exchange, K=
elleher acquires a valuable marketing tool: He will offer prospective buyer=
s a home with an expanse of much-treasured waterfront green space.</p><p cl=
ass=3D"">   Streeterville residents support the project on the north bank o=
f the Chicago River at Lake Shore Drive, but they &quot;continue to be conc=
erned about traffic, completion of a [lakeside] bike path and the [DuSable]=
 park,&quot; said Gail Spreen, president of the Streeterville Organization =
of Active Residents . She asked that neighbors be kept informed of project =
plans.</p><p class=3D"">   If, as expected, the spire gets a green light fr=
om the city, the 40 months of construction will get under way this spring, =
said Thomas Murphy, general counsel to Shelbourne. But, he added, the devel=
opment firm has not yet hired a general contractor. It also has not started=
 pre-construction marketing, routine for U.S. projects that will seek outsi=
de financing. But Kelleher said that during the third quarter he will start=
 selling residences in the tower, which is expected to have 1,200 luxury co=
ndominiums, retail space and underground parking.</p>              <div cla=

           </text></p><div class=3D""><p class=3D"">   If you would have to=
ld me a week ago that I'd be impressed with a Phil Stacey performance, I wo=
uld have laughed in your face.</p><p class=3D"">   But there you are -- Sta=
cey was by far one of the best performers in Tuesday's &quot;American Idol,=
&quot; which featured country music as the theme. It's not really my favori=
te genre, so I expected to be bored, but there were a couple of really good=
 performances. Too bad they were front-loaded at the beginning of the night=
.</p><p class=3D"">   But overshadowing the good performances of Stacey and=
 Jordin Sparks was, of course, the Sanjaya Factor. Could it be any more cle=
ar that the &quot;Idol&quot; producers are once again trying to stir the Sa=
njaya Malakar pot? That allegedly antagonistic banter between Ryan Seacrest=
 and Simon Cowell after the puffy-haired contestant performed was utterly f=
ake and scripted, at least that's how it looked from where I was sitting, d=
awg.</p><p class=3D"">   Ryan's faux outrage over Simon's harsh words was a=
s artificially inflated as Sanjaya's hair. Please. It's all just part of &q=
uot;Idol's&quot; campaign to turn the show into &quot;As the Sanjaya Turns,=
&quot; a weekly soap about hairstyles and hype. Perhaps they feel the need =
to pump that aspect of the show in order to halt the ratings slide that sho=
ws no sign of slowing down.</p><p class=3D"">   The truth of the matter is,=
 while &quot;Idol&quot; is clearly still the Death Star of television, rati=
ngs are trending downward for the show this season. In some cases, ratings =
are down more than 10 percent over the same period a year or two years ago.=
</p><p class=3D"">   Sure, any other television executive would kill for a =
show that rakes in about 28 million viewers for a typical episode, but &quo=
t;Idol's&quot; ratings have been down across the board in the last month or=
 two, and the early onset of daylight-saving time no longer cuts it as an e=
xcuse. No doubt other networks are salivating at the idea that &quot;Idol&q=
uot; could be slipping. But who knows how long this ratings dip will last?<=
/p><p class=3D"">   At this point, you have to wonder if it would be better=
 or worse if Sanjaya were ejected. On the one hand, he clearly doesn't dese=
rve to be there vocally and is costing the show whatever scraps of credibil=
ity it has left.</p><p class=3D"">   Maybe people are really tuning out bec=
ause of Sanjaya -- but other explanations are equally valid. Perhaps Americ=
a's love affair with the show is waning. Or maybe this year we just have a =
pretty boring bunch of contestants overall, as even Simon admitted in a rec=
ent interview.</p><p class=3D"">   On the other hand, the man gives us some=
thing to talk about. And that's really the name of the game.</p><p class=3D=
"">   As for Sanjaya's singing, here's a radical thought -- Sanjaya does ha=
ve a nice vocal tone, when he projects his voice and sings in the right key=
 and doesn't flatten out the notes. The problem is, he only does that about=
 30 percent of the time. The rest of the time, he's off the beat, off key, =
singing flatly and just hurting my eardrums. All things considered, he does=
n't deserve to be on the show.</p><p class=3D"">   But I have to give him p=
rops for working the controversy over his &quot;Idol&quot; stint like a pro=
. Yet another crazy hairdo emerged Tuesday, and he worked the stage and the=
 crowd like an old hand. Say what you want to about Sanjaya, but there are =
major hair-care endorsements in his future. So shed no tears for his bank a=
ccount.</p><p class=3D"">   But let's face it, people, even Paula Abdul cou=
ldn't find it in her heart to say lots of gushy things about many of Tuesda=
y's performances.</p><p class=3D"">   Could Sanjaya, and the mostly bland f=
inal contestants, represent the beginning of the end for this ratings behem=
oth?</p><p class=3D"">   ----------</p><p class=3D"">   <a href=3D"mailto:m=

 south suburban man was killed and a woman hospitalized with multiple gunsh=
ot wounds Thursday morning after a shooting in a quiet Richton Park communi=
ty, authorities said.</p><p class=3D"">   Carlton Banks, who was listed as =
living both in Richton Park and Country Club Hills, suffered a gunshot woun=
d  in the head as the result of a domestic situation, police said. But Rich=
ton Park police, who did not name the injured woman, said they are still in=
vestigating the shooting to find out what exactly happened.</p><p class=3D"=
">   The man and woman were married, Richton Park Police Chief Vito Mannino=
 said. But police don't know if they were living together in the housing co=
mplex or what led to the shooting.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;We still have =
detectives working on it, and I don't have all the facts,&quot; Mannino sai=
d. &quot;The initial indication is one shot the other and then shot themsel=
ves.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   According to a news release, police learned =
of the shooting at about 7:45 a.m. when residents in the Lioncrest Townhous=
e complex called, saying they heard gunshots. When officers arrived at the =
complex near 219th Street and Governors Highway, they found Banks lying on =
the ground in a parking lot, police said. His wife was about 20 yards away.=
 A 32-caliber semiautomatic handgun and numerous shell casings were recover=
ed from the scene, police added.</p><p class=3D"">   Both victims were tran=
sported to St. James Hospital Olympia Fields where Banks was pronounced dea=
d at about 10 a.m. Mannino did not know the woman's condition.</p><p class=
=3D"">   The shooting shook up the quiet community of privately owned town =
homes, where violent crime is uncommon. According to neighbors, at least on=
e of the victims lived in the 3000 block of Richton Place, but none knew ei=
ther of the victims.</p><p class=3D"">   Diane Harris, 67, said she heard a=
 woman screaming and then heard the shots. When she looked out her window, =
she was shocked to see a man's body in the parking lot.</p><p class=3D"">  =
 &quot;I started praying right away,&quot; she said. &quot;I didn't know wh=
at had been done or what happened. We're not used to this kind of stuff. It=
's a very quiet neighborhood.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Harris' neighbor Ti=
m Barnes Jr. said the shooting gave pause to all the residents.</p><p class=

   A movie about childhood and justice set in Southern small-town Depressio=
n-era America (Macomb County, Ala.), that feels like a classic from its ver=
y first moments, when it opens with a lyrical black-and-white credits seque=
nce with spare piano music and a keepsake box. Based on Harper Lee's much-l=
oved novel, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is a portrait of her own yout=
h and relationship with her father, fictionalized in the film as upright, b=
rave lawyer Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck). Lee's surrogate character, tomboy=
 Scout (Mary Badham), roams the town with older brother Jem (Philip Alford)=
 and their brainy, pint-size pal Dill (a character modeled on Lee's childho=
od friend Truman Capote and played by John Megna). As she explores, she lea=
rns; in some ways, Lee's novel is a female equivalent to Mark Twain's &quot=
;Huckleberry Finn.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Few films have caught the spec=
ial feel and rhythms of childhood so well, with such uncondescending warmth=
 and humor. And few bring out more powerfully the themes of anti-racism and=
 the virtues and joys of community and family. The stirring courtroom scene=
, in which Finch defends an African-American man (Brock Peters as Tom Robin=
son) falsely accused of rape, keys  the whole film. So do the climactic sce=
nes with Robert Duvall (in his movie debut) as the mysterious recluse Boo R=
adley. This beautiful, crisply compassionate adaptation -- from director Ro=
bert Mulligan, producer Alan Pakula, screenwriter Horton Foote and composer=
 Elmer Bernstein -- pierces and gladdens the heart. The credits don't lie: =

yricism and despair in writer-director Akin's taut, driving evocation of th=

coastal community that, in the space of a few weeks, seems merrily on the r=

2005 Chicago developer Christopher Carley unveils a twisting, 115-story sky=
scraper designed by Zurich-based architect Santiago Calatrava. The tower in=
cludes hotel rooms and condominiums. The building?s roof rises to 1,458 fee=
t, with a steel spire bringing its height to 2,000 feet. Parking is in a po=
dium at the tower's base. Photo (color): April 2007 The Chicago Plan Commis=
sion approves the final design for the Chicago Spire. This version has a ta=
pering, conelike profile, and would make a 360-degree rotation from ground =
to summit. Plans call for the building to house about 1,200 condominiums an=
d to be integrated with new lakefront and riverfront open space. Photo (col=
or): December 2006 With Dublin-based developer [Garrett Kelleher] having ta=
ken control of the project, a new design emerges, 150 stories tall with 1,3=
00 condos and no broadcast antenna or hotel. The skyscraper has an almost f=

 in earnest, and the odds are now better than even money that it will succe=
ed as a work of skyline sculpture and as a building that engages the city a=
round it.</p><p class=3D"">   After months of struggle, Zurich-based archit=
ect Santiago Calatrava finally has been able to make a winning match betwee=
n visual poetry and the harsh realities of economics in his design for the =
twisting, 2,000-foot Chicago Spire, which would be the nation's tallest bui=
lding.</p><p class=3D"">   Even if the design that the Chicago Plan Commiss=
ion approved Thursday lacks some of the balletic elan of the original plan =
for this tower unveiled two years ago, it remains a powerful sculptural obj=
ect with a strong structural rationale -- an innovative successor to such g=
reat Chicago skyscrapers as the twin corncobs of Bertrand Goldberg's Marina=
 City.</p><p class=3D"">   But the 150-story tower is nonetheless a gamble,=
 and not just for the developer, Dublin-based Garrett Kelleher, who insists=
 this is no pie-in-the-sky skyscraper even if he refuses to reveal its cost=
 or the price tag of its condos.</p><p class=3D"">   No one has ever built =
a twisting tower this tall, though a smaller version of this type is under =
construction in Dubai. For all the allure of Calatrava's architectural mode=
ls, the Spire they show is as much an abstract sculpture as it is a real bu=
ilding. One wonders how the stunning geometry will look when everyday neces=
sities -- windows, for instance -- intrude.</p><p class=3D"">   At best, th=
is will be a new Eiffel Tower, a scale-shattering yet superb skyline statem=
ent that becomes the new postcard image of Chicago.</p><p class=3D"">   At =
worst, as less persuasive renderings of the tower suggest, it will be a vis=
ual cartoon, a supersize, superskinny version of a soft- serve ice cream co=
ne.</p><p class=3D"">   Inevitably, some will lament that this is not the o=
riginal version of the tower, called the Fordham Spire, which proposed a ho=
tel and communications antenna as well as condos on a vacant site west of L=
ake Shore Drive and on the north bank of the Chicago River. But that design=
 was a seductive fantasy. This one, which would house about 1,200 condomini=
ums, is striving to be real.</p><p class=3D"">   Certainly, it has made gre=
at strides toward balancing form and finance, especially since December, wh=
en Calatrava made public a banal, nearly flat-topped version of the skyscra=
per. It instantly was tagged &quot;Twizzler Tower&quot; for resembling a pi=
ece of licorice.</p><p class=3D"">   Since then, the restless architect has=
 moved gradually to the present plan, in which the tower rises energeticall=
y but nobly, making a 360-degree twist as it moves from the ground to a sha=
rply articulated summit.</p><p class=3D"">   In January, he unveiled sketch=
es to the Tribune that gave the tower a newly pointed top and promised a re=
storation of the tower's whirling upward drive. Then, accommodating complex=
 structural requirements, he settled on the current design, which is somewh=
at bulkier than the pencil-like January version but remains attractively sl=
ender. Gone is another version, also revealed to community groups last mont=
h, that had too much twist in its top and revealed Calatrava's tendency to =
lapse into the visually hyperactive.</p><p class=3D"">   But the sky-high a=
esthetic risks haven't disappeared.</p><p class=3D"">   Materials make a di=
fference</p><p class=3D"">   Calatrava needs to settle on materials -- he w=
ants the exterior to include stainless steel, like the cladding of the much=
-admired Inland Steel Building of 1958 at 30 W. Monroe St. -- yet how they =
are detailed and manufactured is crucial.</p><p class=3D"">   The gap betwe=
en vision and reality is already apparent in the glass exterior of the unde=
r-construction, 1,362-foot Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower by the Chi=
cago office of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill. Renderings by the architect =
showed an elegant glass skin, but parts of the exterior as built bring to m=
ind distorted fun-house mirrors.</p><p class=3D"">   However the skyline dr=
ama turns out, the Spire has a greatly improved, ground-level design that b=
elies the rap that Calatrava's skyscrapers are like ice sculptures, chillin=
g the cities around them.</p><p class=3D"">   More-approachable approach</p=
><p class=3D"">   With Kelleher's encouragement, the architect has moved fa=
r beyond the original Fordham Spire plan, in which a ziggurat-shaped parkin=
g podium surrounded the tower's base and pretty much held the city at bay.<=
/p><p class=3D"">   Instead, with Kelleher approving an expensive undergrou=
nd parking garage and asking the architect to plan the proposed 3.2-acre Du=
Sable Park just to the east, Calatrava has given this enormous tower the fi=
ne-grained detail it needs to be a city-enlivening addition to both the riv=
erfront and the lakefront.</p><p class=3D"">   The appealing features inclu=
de a grand, circular plaza set between the tower and the north bank of the =
Chicago River. In addition, Calatrava's plans call for pedestrian passagewa=
ys that will lead beneath the superstructure of Lake Shore Drive to the pro=
posed DuSable Park, where Calatrava would handsomely sculpt the landscape. =
Undoubtedly Kelleher will market the tower as sitting in a 5-acre park, not=
 the 2-acre building site. But the plans also promise to make this skyscrap=
er much more than just an object to be ogled from afar.</p><p class=3D"">  =
 True, traffic remains a concern, especially because tourists are sure to f=
lock to this building. Signs will be needed to point those who come on whee=
ls to nearby parking garages. Wisely, the tower's garage won't be open to t=
he public, which should prevent a recurrence of the 1993 terrorist attack o=
n the World Trade Center, when a bomb-laden van exploded in the center's un=
derground parking garage, killing six people and injuring more than 1,000.<=
/p><p class=3D"">   For all the questions looming around the Spire, however=
, this much is clear: The planned skyscraper has the aesthetic and urban de=
sign stature to match its projected height. Now the great drama begins: Wil=
l this thing actually get built? Will the reality match the promise?</p><p =
class=3D"">   Yes, Calatrava said Wednesday in an interview, explaining tha=
t the developer already is getting bids for caissons. His talents as a real=
 estate oddsmaker, one hopes, are a match for his skills in shaping skyscra=
pers.</p><p class=3D"">   ----------</p><p class=3D"">   <a href=3D"mailto:=

quarter results Thursday, colored by a 12 percent slide in operating cash f=
low as the newspaper industry continued to suffer erosion in advertising re=
venue and circulation.</p><p class=3D"">   The company's results lagged beh=
ind its peers, turning up the heat on the Chicago-based media conglomerate,=
 which early this month announced plans to take itself private in partnersh=
ip with billionaire Sam Zell.</p><p class=3D"">   Faced with declining reve=
nue and pressure to cut costs, the company is planning to offer employee bu=
youts to eliminate jobs, said sources familiar with the situation.</p><p cl=
ass=3D"">   These sources didn't know how many jobs are targeted companywid=
e but said the Chicago Tribune Co. is expected to issue a request for buyou=
ts on Monday, with a goal of eliminating 100 positions. If the offers don't=
 generate enough savings, one source said, the company may resort to layoff=
s.</p><p class=3D"">   A spokesman wouldn't comment on the cuts and didn't =
make executives available to  discuss the quarterly results.</p><p class=3D=
"">   Tribune, which also owns the Los Angeles Times, WGN-Ch. 9 and other m=
edia properties, has been cutting jobs at its various properties for severa=
l years. One source said the current effort is part of Tribune Co.'s previo=
usly announced push to shave $200 million in expenses over the next two yea=
rs, a target that is built in to the assumptions of the bankers financing t=
he Zell buyout plan.</p><p class=3D"">   That deal has increased pressure o=
n Tribune to improve results, or at least maintain last year's level of cas=
h flow, amid a slump in advertising and circulation revenue as readers defe=
ct to the Internet.</p><p class=3D"">   But Thursday's numbers showed that =
Tribune's financial results continued to erode in the first quarter, and an=
alysts said there was no evidence the company has hit bottom.</p><p class=
=3D"">   Tribune reported a net loss of $15.6 million in the first quarter,=
 compared with a gain of $102.8 million a year earlier. But those results i=
ncluded a slew of one-time factors, and analysts paid more attention to the=
 decline in operating cash flow to $238 million from $271 million. Cash flo=
w is what companies use to pay down debt.</p><p class=3D"">   Several other=
 big newspaper publishers, including Gannett Co. and the New York Times Co.=
, also reported declines in advertising and circulation revenues this week.=
 But Tribune's results were &quot;on the weaker side,&quot; said John Pucha=
lla, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service.</p><p class=3D"">   He pointe=
d out that Tribune's newspaper revenue fell 5.5 percent versus an average d=
ecline of 2.3 percent for other companies reporting results.</p><p class=3D=
"">   The most alarming aspect of the Tribune report was the drop in cash f=
low. Despite a 4 percent decline in overall revenue, to $1.2 billion, and a=
 2 percent drop in expenses, Tribune's operating cash flow fell much more p=
recipitously.</p><p class=3D"">   The reason is that Tribune is fast losing=
 revenue in high-margin businesses such as real estate and help-wanted clas=
sified ads. The costs associated with classified ads are low, so as volume =
increases, profit climbs. But when volume declines, it comes straight out o=
f earnings.</p><p class=3D"">   Mike Simonton, an analyst for Fitch Ratings=
 in Chicago, said that real estate classifieds in particular propped up Tri=
bune earnings in 2005 and for much of 2006. But when the boom turned to bus=
t, especially in Florida, &quot;a disproportionate amount of profit came of=
f the table,&quot; he said.</p><p class=3D"">   Tribune has insulated itsel=
f to some degree by building online classified businesses like <a href=3D"h=
ttp://CareerBuilder.com" class=3D"">CareerBuilder.com</a> and <a href=3D"ht=
tp://Apartments.com" class=3D"">Apartments.com</a>. But even though online =
revenue grew a promising 17 percent during the quarter, to $60 million, tha=
t is only 5 percent of the company's total.</p><p class=3D"">   Zell, who i=
s leading an effort to take Tribune private in a complex deal that will inv=
olve taking on $8.4 billion in new debt, wasn't fazed by the results. The f=
irst-quarter results were &quot;well within our expectations,&quot; Zell sa=
id, pointing out that the falloff in real estate classifieds was exaggerate=
d by bad comparisons.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;Florida is going through on=
e of its every-five-year periods of oversupply,&quot; he said. &quot;The nu=
mbers a year ago were off the charts.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Since he em=
erged as the winner in the Tribune bidding in early April, however, Zell ha=
s said he doesn't believe that cost-cutting will solve the company's proble=
ms. He and Tribune Chief Executive Dennis FitzSimons have said the company =
will be able to pay down its heavy debt load if it can simply maintain last=
 year's cash-flow level of $1.4 billion. But to do that, they will have to =
find ways to wring better performance out of the company's old-media assets=
.</p><p class=3D"">   One source close to the company said the covenants on=
 the debt agreements financing the deal give Tribune some wiggle room this =
year. But the banks likely expect better results as the year moves forward.=
</p><p class=3D"">   That helps explain why FitzSimons invited Harvard Busi=
ness School professor John Kotter, a noted expert on leading change, to com=
e address his top managers on Wednesday. Kotter talked about creating a sen=
se of urgency and removing the barriers that get in the way of doing new th=
ings, sources said. They added that FitzSimons told the assembled executive=
s that the company is adopting Kotter's eight- step program for guiding cha=
nge, and that their only choice was to get on board.</p><p class=3D"">   So=
me attendees said that it wasn't clear what their marching orders were, but=
 one said, &quot;It was a good start.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;There=
 was an urgency to move forward,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to transform.=

in a powerful turn as Fagin, a performance attacked in its day for anti-Sem=

about a botched IRA bank robbery and the badly wounded and increasingly fev=
erish rebel, Johnny (James Mason), who wanders Belfast with both his mates =
and the police on his trail. Newton pops up again as the mad painter Lukey.=

class=3D""><p class=3D"">   Republican presidential contender John McCain, =
known for having a quirky sense of humor, joked about bombing Iran at a cam=
paign appearance this week.</p><p class=3D"">   In response to an audience =
question about military action against Iran, the Arizona senator briefly sa=
ng the chorus of &quot;Barbara Ann.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;That ol=
d, eh, that old Beach Boys song, Bomb Iran,&quot; he said in jest Wednesday=
, chuckling with the crowd. Then, he softly sang to the melody: &quot;Bomb,=
 bomb, bomb, bomb, anyway, ah.  ... &quot; The audience responded with more=
 laughter.</p><p class=3D"">   His quip was prompted by a man in the audien=
ce who asked: &quot;How many times do we have to prove that these people ar=
e blowing up people now, never mind if they get a nuclear weapon, when do w=
e send 'em an airmail message to Tehran?&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   The camp=
aign stop was in Murrells Inlet, S.C.</p><p class=3D"">   After his joke, M=
cCain turned serious and said that he agrees with President Bush that the U=
nited States must protect Israel from Iran and work to prevent Iran from ac=
quiring nuclear weapons. McCain has long said the military option should no=
t be taken off the table but  used only as a last resort.</p><p class=3D"">=
   The episode echoed President Reagan's 1984 quip at the height of the nuc=
lear arms race when he said: &quot;My fellow Americans, I'm pleased to tell=
 you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We=
 begin bombing in five minutes.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Reagan was testin=
g a microphone before his regular Saturday radio address.</p><p class=3D"">=

ichardson's aggressive steps after raising $6.25 million in the first quart=

 City Mayor Michael Bloomberg gathered the city's wealthiest and most activ=
e political donors Thursday -- and didn't ask for money.</p><p class=3D""> =
  Instead, he reminded his guests at the posh Four Seasons restaurant that =
before they give, they should make sure the candidate is on New York's side=
 on a checklist of issues, including funds for ailing Ground Zero workers.<=

p><div class=3D""><p class=3D"">   A U.S. military brigade is constructing =
a 3-mile-long concrete wall to cut off one of Baghdad's most restive Sunni =
Arab districts from the Shiite Muslim neighborhoods that surround it, raisi=
ng concern about the further Balkanization of Iraq's capital.</p><p class=
=3D"">   U.S. commanders in northern Baghdad say the 12-foot-high barrier w=
ill make it harder for suicide bombers, death squads and militia fighters f=
rom sectarian factions to attack one another and slip back to their home tu=
rf. Construction began last week and is expected to be completed by the end=
 of the month.</p><p class=3D"">   Although Baghdad is replete with blast w=
alls, checkpoints and other temporary barriers, including a massive wall ar=
ound the Green Zone, the wall being constructed in Adhamiya would be the fi=
rst to essentially divide a neighborhood by sect.</p><p class=3D"">   A lar=
gely Sunni district, Adhamiya is one of Baghdad's flash points, avoided not=
 only by Shiites but also by Sunni outsiders. The area is almost completely=
 surrounded by Shiite-dominated districts.</p><p class=3D"">   The ambitiou=
s project is a sign of how far the U.S. military will go to end the non-sto=
p bloodshed in Iraq. But U.S. officials said the barrier is not a central t=
actic of the security crackdown announced Feb. 13.</p><p class=3D"">   &quo=
t;We defer to commanders on the ground, but dividing up the entire city wit=
h barriers is not part of the plan,&quot; U.S. military spokesman Lt. Col. =
Christopher Garver said Thursday.</p><p class=3D"">   News of the construct=
ion was first reported Thursday by the newspaper Stars and Stripes.</p><p c=
lass=3D"">   Sunnis and Shiites living in the shadow of the barrier are uni=
ted in their contempt for the imposing new structure.</p><p class=3D"">   &=
quot;Are they trying to divide us into different sectarian cantons?&quot; s=
aid a Sunni drugstore owner in Adhamiya who identified himself as Abu Ahmed=
, 44. &quot;This will deepen the sectarian strife and only serve to abort e=
fforts aimed at reconciliation.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Some of Ahmed's c=
ustomers come from Shiite or mixed neighborhoods that are now cut off by la=
rge barriers along a highway. Customers and others seeking to cross into th=
e Sunni district must park their cars outside Adhamiya, walk through a narr=
ow pedestrian passage in the walls and catch taxis on the other side.</p><p=
 class=3D"">   Several residents interviewed likened the project to the mas=
sive barriers built around some Palestinian zones in Israel.</p><p class=3D=
"">   &quot;Are we in the West Bank?&quot; asked Abu Qusay, 48, a pharmacis=
t who said that access to his favorite kebab restaurant in Adhamiya has bee=
n cut off.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;I feel this is the beginning of a patt=
ern of what the whole of Iraq is going to look like, divided by sectarian a=
nd racial criteria,&quot; said Abu Marwan, 50, a Shiite pharmacist.</p><p c=
lass=3D"">   The construction in Adhamiya is not the first time U.S. milita=
ry planners have attempted to isolate hostile regions. In 2005, U.S. troops=
 tried to surround the Sunni-dominated city of Samarra with earthen berms t=
o prevent insurgents from entering and leaving the city. A similar strategy=

ding to Roland Dobbins, a network engineer who helps develop security solut=
ions for Cisco Systems.</p><p class=3D"">   * Do it yourself: Connect and d=
isconnect from the Internet manually by right clicking on the wireless Inte=
rnet icon and either enabling or disabling the connection. This prevents yo=
ur computer from searching out Internet and possibly fake access points aut=
omatically without your knowledge.</p><p class=3D"">   * Be unique: Change =
default names of your network from &quot;Linksys&quot; to a unique name (no=
t your home address) and change any default passwords as soon as possible.<=
/p><p class=3D"">   * Don't share: Keeping your network open or allowing ot=
hers access to shared files leaves a big hole in your system for hackers. D=
eactivate all sharing. If you must share because you are on a corporate net=
work, make sure you change these settings when you are outside the office.<=
/p><p class=3D"">   * Be selective: In the computing world, promiscuity is =
a sure way of getting yourself a virus or attracting a hacker. Connect to &=
quot;infrastructure&quot; points, or official access points, rather than &q=
uot;peer-to-peer&quot; connections, or another user's computer. Set your Ne=
twork Connections to only connect to infrastructure points. The default sea=
rches for all open hot spots.</p><p class=3D"">   Be wary: If you get an e-=
mail from your bank, make sure the e- mail is indeed from your bank and tha=
t you are being routed to the bank. Put your cursor over the link and look =
at the address, or right click on properties and see where it will lead you=
. Always go to the bank site via its main site in a new window, not via a l=
ink in an e-mail. Also, if your computer pops up with a security certificat=
e warning, do not click away without inspecting the certificate and the sig=
nature. Even then, certificates are easily faked. If you must continue usin=
g the Internet, do not do anything sensitive. Best thing to do? Walk away.<=
/p><p class=3D"">   ... And if you fail?</p><p class=3D"">   Computers get =
compromised all the time. Your reaction can save you a lot of agony. First,=
 turn off your computer immediately, do not reboot, and disconnect it. Then=
 call your help desk. Once you get your computer back up, change all passwo=
rds.</p><p class=3D""> Credit: Los Angeles Times</p>            </div><div =

nhill ski club in the country. In the early days of downhill skiing, he fre=
quently traveled by train to Sun Valley and Aspen where he enjoyed skiing w=
ith many of the early ski pioneers. When not skiing in the West, he served =
as the head of the Ski School at Gander Mountain Ski Area. Mr. Scoville pla=
yed golf as a junior member of the Riverside Golf Club with a one handicap.=
 He later joined the Barrington Hills Country Club where he was a member fo=
r over 35 years. Mr. Scoville enjoyed hunting, fishing, skeet and trap shoo=
ting and was a member of the Barrington Sportsmen's Club. He and his wife P=
eggy were avid hunters traveling north to bow hunt, camping in their canvas=
 replica of &quot;Sitting Bull's&quot; teepee; and venturing to Wyoming, Mo=
ntana and Idaho in pursuit of black bear, deer, elk and antelope. Mr. Scovi=
lle was an expert duck caller. His passion for duck hunting along the Illin=
ois flyway zone, near the Kankakee River, was born from early trips with hi=
s father and mother. A lifelong naturalist, he was a founding Director of C=
itizens for Conservation in Barrington. He also served on the Board of the =
North Barrington Association. He founded Scoville Fish Hatchery, raising ma=
ture northern pike for the purposes of stocking local lakes. He also raised=

hed and the difference he made their lives. His honesty, integrity and devo=
tion to his family was admired by his family and friends. He was the husban=

xt></p><div class=3D""><p class=3D"">   The political hurdles facing the de=
veloper of a proposed tower in Chicago that would be North America's talles=
t structure don't seem nearly as daunting as the financial ones.</p><p clas=
s=3D"">   The Chicago Spire took another step toward becoming a 2,000-foot-=
 high reality Thursday when the Chicago Plan Commission recommended that it=
s current design by famed architect Santiago Calatrava be approved by the c=
ity zoning committee.</p><p class=3D"">   But given Garrett Kelleher's reti=
cence to reveal project cost or unit prices and the fact that he has yet to=
 start marketing or secure the necessary loans, questions abound about the =
financial feasibility of a project that could cost more than $2 billion.</p=
><p class=3D"">   During the hearing, Kelleher, chief executive of Shelbour=
ne Development Ltd. of Dublin, said the tower would be &quot;a unique build=
ing in a happening city.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Regarding questions abou=
t the project's finances, Kelleher told the commission that a top executive=
 at the Anglo Irish Bank, headquartered in Dublin, &quot;fully supports me =
and I have shown their letter to the City of Chicago.&quot;</p><p class=3D"=
">   But one high-rise developer wonders if that would be sufficient.</p><p=
 class=3D"">   &quot;The world's tallest buildings are so expensive that th=
ey need countries or major corporations to bankroll them,&quot; said Steven=
 Fifield, chairman of the Fifield Cos., which has built office and resident=
ial towers in Chicago and elsewhere in the U.S. &quot;The Anglo Irish Bank =
is not big enough to be the sole lending source on a project that could app=
roach $1,000 a square foot to develop.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;That just =
isn't credible.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Moving through the city approval =
process, Kelleher's firm  wants to increase the amount of space to be built=
 on its 2.2-acre lakefront site to 25 times the lot size, rather than 10 ti=
mes the lot size. That would enable Shelbourne Development to build a 2.4 m=
illion-square-foot tower. It also seeks permission to build exit and entry =
ramps linked to Lake Shore Drive.</p><p class=3D"">   Now that he has the P=
lan Commission's approval, Kelleher will ask the City Council's Zoning Comm=
ittee for its OK  of the twisting 150- story tower's design and site plan T=
hursday. If he clears that hurdle, he'll bring his project to the full City=
 Council on May 9 for the final go-ahead.</p><p class=3D"">   Prospects app=
ear good.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;This is a wonderful project, and everyo=
ne is very enthused,&quot; said Constance Buscemi, spokeswoman for the city=
's Planning Department.</p><p class=3D"">   Shelbourne also has offered to =
pay $9 million toward the development of the nearby 3.2-acre DuSable Park. =
In exchange, Kelleher acquires a valuable marketing tool: He will offer pro=
spective buyers a home with an expanse of much-treasured waterfront green s=
pace.</p><p class=3D"">   Streeterville residents support the project on th=
e north bank of the Chicago River at Lake Shore Drive, but they &quot;conti=
nue to be concerned about traffic, completion of a [lakeside] bike path and=
 the [DuSable] park,&quot; said Gail Spreen, president of the Streeterville=
 Organization of Active Residents. She asked that neighbors be kept informe=
d of project plans.</p><p class=3D"">   If, as expected, the spire gets a g=
reen light from the city, the 40 months of construction will get under way =
this spring, said Thomas Murphy, general counsel to Shelbourne. But, he add=
ed, the development firm has not yet hired a general contractor. It also ha=
s not started pre-construction marketing, routine for U.S. projects that wi=
ll seek outside financing. But Kelleher said that during the third quarter =
he will start selling residences in the tower, which is expected to have 1,=
200 luxury condominiums, retail space and underground parking.</p><p class=
=3D"">   Real estate experts have estimated the project's cost could reach =
$2.4 billion, and at a time of rising construction costs, building such a t=
all structure is even more expensive because the higher it soars, the more =
complicated the engineering.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;Tall buildings, espe=
cially when they are slender, must be stiffer to withstand the force of win=
d, which means that the structure calls for more steel, an expensive prospe=
ct,&quot; Fifield said.</p><p class=3D"">   Furthermore, such towers requir=
e that more interior space be devoted to elevator service, so there's less =
space to sell. Murphy said he expects the Spire to yield only about 65 perc=
ent sellable space.</p><p class=3D"">   Another factor that could increase =
the complexity and cost of the project would be excavating to build undergr=
ound parking so close to the water. To dig below the water level while keep=
ing the site dry, Shelbourne would use a process called slurry wall constru=
ction that calls for great skill and time, both costly commodities.</p><p c=
lass=3D"">   Given the cost, Shelbourne might have to sell the units for $1=
,500 a square foot or more.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;You can get that in N=
ew York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, London,&quot; Fifield said. &quot;But Chic=
ago is a kick-the-tires kind of town, so that will be more of a challenge.&=
quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Kelleher plans to market the Spire worldwide in s=
uch places as Dubai, Russia's St. Petersburg, Beijing, Singapore and Madrid=
, in addition to New York and other parts of the U.S. Already, he said, &qu=
ot;the number of inquiries exceeds the number of units. I have no doubt thi=
s project will sell out.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   ----------</p><p class=

cchio, who built Qwest Communications International Inc. into the nation's =
fourth-largest phone company and presided over a $100 billion drop in the c=
ompany's market value before being ousted as chief executive in June 2002, =
was convicted of insider trading Thursday.</p><p class=3D"">   A federal ju=
ry found Nacchio guilty of selling stock based on private warnings from top=
 lieutenants that the company would miss revenue targets. Prosecutors said =
Nacchio made $101 million by illegally trading on inside information he wit=
hheld from investors.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;If you don't tell, you can'=
t sell,&quot; Assistant U.S. Atty. Colleen Conry told jurors in closing arg=
uments.</p><p class=3D"">   The jury found Nacchio guilty on 19 counts of i=
nsider trading for stock trades totaling $52 million. He was found not guil=
ty of 23 counts relating to earlier trades totaling $49 million.</p><p clas=
s=3D"">   The conviction of Nacchio, 57, caps a crackdown on corporate frau=
d that began when Enron Corp. collapsed in 2001. Hundreds of executives hav=
e been convicted, including three other former CEOs: Enron's Jeffrey Skilli=
ng, Bernard Ebbers of WorldCom Inc. and John Rigas, founder of Adelphia Com=
munications Corp.</p><p class=3D"">   Nacchio left the courthouse with his =
wife, Anne, without commenting. The panel of eight men and four women convi=
cted Nacchio after six days of deliberations. He faces up to 10 years in pr=
ison and a $1 million fine on each count. U.S. District Judge Edward Nottin=
gham set Nacchio's sentencing for July 27.</p><p class=3D"">   Nacchio, who=
 was CEO from 1997 to 2002,  did not testify in his own defense at the four=
-week trial. Defense lawyers said he acted in good faith and believed Qwest=
 would meet the projections after buying US West in 2000. Nacchio sold stoc=
k to diversify his portfolio, exercising options due to expire, his lawyers=
 said.</p><p class=3D"">   Before the trial Nacchio said he would present e=
vidence that he believed Qwest would make its forecast because he alone kne=
w of the company's chances of securing secret government contracts. Nacchio=
 never presented such evidence because of unfavorable rulings from Nottingh=
am.</p><p class=3D"">   Nacchio joined Qwest from AT&amp;T Inc. in 1997 and=
 continued to return to his New Jersey home on weekends.  Qwest directors o=
usted him in June 2002 as a criminal probe began.  Nacchio  was not charged=
 with involvement in the accounting manipulations that later led Qwest to e=
rase $2.5 billion in revenue.</p><p class=3D"">   During the trial former Q=
west President Afshin Mohebbi said he warned Nacchio in December 2000 that =
the targets would be a &quot;huge stretch.&quot; Former Chief Financial Off=
icer Robin Szeliga testified that she warned  him of a $1 billion gap.</p><=
p class=3D"">   Nacchio's lawyers said those discussions were about higher =
internal budgets, not public targets given to investors.</p><p class=3D""> =
  Qwest made its earnings targets in the first two quarters, and Nacchio be=
lieved in forecasts first devised by investment bankers, defense attorney H=
erbert Stern said in his closing arguments.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;Maybe=
 his business projections didn't come true,&quot; Stern said. &quot;Maybe t=
he same optimism, energy, drive and ambition that built the company in the =
first place led him in the end to miscalculate what could be achieved in th=
e terrible year of 2001. That may be true. But that is not a crime.&quot;</=
p><p class=3D"">   Nacchio still faces a lawsuit from the Securities and Ex=
change Commission that accuses him of directing a $3 billion accounting fra=
ud. He also faces investor lawsuits.</p><p class=3D"">   Qwest shares reach=
ed a closing high of $64 in March 2000 on expectations of a surge in the us=
e of its fiber-optic network. Nacchio took advantage of investor optimism t=
o load up on debt that financed a nationwide phone-and-data network. As oth=
er companies also rushed to capitalize on the expected growth in demand, a =
glut of network capacity developed, causing prices for sending calls and da=
ta signals to fall.</p>              <div class=3D""><div class=3D""><stron=

s=3D"">   It's not easy being green, especially if you want to build a home=
 that produces its own power. Nor is it cheap.</p><p class=3D"">   Since th=
ere are no large-scale green subdivisions, if you want to build a home that=
 is kind to the environment, you often have to pay dearly because it's a cu=
stom project.</p><p class=3D"">   Sam Garst, a financial adviser, paid a pr=
emium for his new house near Olympia, Wash. He has done the math and is sat=
isfied with his projected return on investment.</p><p class=3D"">   Since G=
arst was an environmental activist for nine years, he and his wife, Christi=
ne, didn't need convincing to make their home ecodynamic, in harmony with t=
he local environment.</p><p class=3D"">   The Intergovernmental Panel on Cl=
imate Change's recent 1,572- page report on global warming provides some of=
 their rationale.</p><p class=3D"">   The Garsts figured &quot;this was our=
 last move, so we wanted to do something out of the ordinary.&quot;</p><p c=
lass=3D"">   They christened their castle &quot;Zelonedom,&quot; a phonetic=
 equivalent from Polish that means &quot;green home.&quot;</p><p class=3D""=
>   &quot;We didn't do anything over the top,&quot; says Garst, referring t=
o the house's use of existing technology, &quot;but over time what we did w=
ill pay.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   An ecodynamic home is more than just a s=
tick-built house with solar panels. It interacts with the environment to pr=
oduce energy, staying warm in the winter and cool in the summer.</p><p clas=
s=3D"">   These kinds of homes, which need to be mass produced, help addres=
s global warming. Buildings in the U.S. alone consume about 30 percent of a=
ll energy.</p><p class=3D"">   The Garsts' house has no air conditioning; s=
ummers aren't extreme in their area of the Pacific Northwest. A geothermal =
heat pump that uses the Earth's natural temperature to create hot water for=
 radiant, warm floors combined with air from the greenhouse keeps their hom=
e toasty when it's cold outside.</p><p class=3D"">   They also paid attenti=
on to the building envelope, meaning they had walls, windows and ceiling sp=
aces that preserve heat through extensive insulation.</p><p class=3D"">   T=
hey used blown-in ceiling foam equivalent to an R-value of 56, which is a m=
easurement of thermal efficiency. Most homes have roof R- values half of th=
at rating or less.</p><p class=3D"">   On top of their roof, two dozen 190-=
watt solar panels produce about 4.5 kilowatts of electricity. To save on wa=
ter consumption, they have dual-flush toilets and a cistern that stores 5,0=
00 gallons of water, mostly for irrigation during the dry summers. They hav=
e also used recycled and environmentally friendly materials throughout the =
home.</p><p class=3D"">   Like most houses employing solar energy these day=
s, it wouldn't have made economic sense without extensive subsidies.</p><p =
class=3D"">   The local power company paid them a $2,400 rebate on their so=
lar panels in addition to a $2,000 federal tax credit. The cash back came i=
n handy since the panels cost $27,000, or what you would pay for a modest s=
edan. The state also exempted the unit from its 8.2 percent sales tax.</p><=
p class=3D"">   For power they generate, the electric utility will pay the =
Garsts a generous 15 cents per kilowatt hour, for the next 10 years. The el=
ectricity they produce on their own is almost free once they have recouped =
the cost of their system.</p><p class=3D"">   As they are expected to produ=
ce about 5,500 kilowatt hours annually, that will earn them about $825. All=
 told, they figure their total utility bills will run from $35 to $40 per m=
onth for the 2,400 square-foot, all-electric, three-bedroom home.</p><p cla=
ss=3D"">   &quot;By our calculations,&quot; Garst says, &quot;the first-yea=
r return on investment runs over 20 percent and the balance will earn about=
 5.6 percent a year.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   He says that's comparable to=
 &quot;a certificate of deposit in the bank and close to our 6.25 percent m=
ortgage rate. We figure we'll be cash-positive for the first 10 years.&quot=
;</p><p class=3D"">   Garst believes the value of the house will go up.</p>=

p class=3D"">   About four years after Starbucks rebuffed efforts to set up=
 shop in downtown Roselle -- even after an offer of rent-free space from a =
developer -- the coffee retail giant has approached the village with a chan=
ge of heart.</p><p class=3D"">   Now the village hopes Starbucks can help s=
olve its struggling downtown retail market.</p><p class=3D"">   Roselle May=
or Gayle Smolinski said,  &quot;There were no incentives offered at all&quo=
t; this time, but the village's Planning and Zoning Commission recently app=
roved changes to the site the chain picked out.</p><p class=3D"">   After a=
 public hearing, the commission this month voted to allow the site at Rosel=
le Road and Main Street -- previously designated for a restaurant -- to be =
split to allow Starbucks to have a store with drive-through service on one =
side with a small bank on the other.</p><p class=3D"">   Now the proposal i=
s on the fast-track, going before a committee of the whole meeting next wee=
k and likely on the full board's agenda soon after.</p><p class=3D"">   The=
 La Grange-based Gammonley Group, which leases retail storefronts in Rosell=
e, had offered Starbucks rent-free space for four to five years as an incen=
tive to open a store  in 2003, but the chain declined.</p><p class=3D"">   =
With the new deal, Gammonley worked up plans to divide the  site, with a 1,=
900-square-foot Starbucks on one part, and the two-story bank on the other.=
</p><p class=3D"">   Although condo projects downtown have done well, retai=
l planned for nearly 60,000 square feet in projects such as the Village Cro=
ssing, Main Street Station and the forthcoming Park Street Crossing has not=
.</p><p class=3D"">   Officials hope the Seattle-based Starbucks, the first=
 &quot;brand- name&quot; retailer to commit to the western suburb, will cre=
ate a domino effect.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;Starbucks does its homework =
very well and often moves very slowly before committing to an area,&quot; s=
aid community development director Patrick Watkins. &quot;There is name rec=
ognition there, and other businesses tend to see that as a sign a particula=
r site is successful.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Richard Gammonley, executiv=
e vice president of the Gammonley Group, said terms of the agreement were &=
quot;acceptable to all parties,&quot; though he would not describe details.=
</p><p class=3D"">   Gammonley said Starbucks' 2003 rejection of the area  =
was because the company wasn't in the &quot;expansion mode.&quot;</p><p cla=
ss=3D"">   Officials for Starbucks confirmed  the company's interest in the=
 Roselle site but would not discuss details of a proposed deal.</p><p class=
=3D"">   As for Roselle residents, Watkins said that recent marketing surve=
ys revealed that having a coffee shop downtown was at the top of many resid=
ents' lists.</p><p class=3D"">   Now, he said, &quot;We're hoping to attrac=
t other businesses that reflect our surveys, including a breakfast and lunc=
h restaurant and a couple of specialty stores.&quot;</p><p class=3D""> Cred=

p class=3D"">   A preacher's wife testified at her murder trial Wednesday t=
hat her husband abused her physically and sexually, but she said the shotgu=
n fired accidentally as she pointed it at him in their parsonage bedroom.</=
p><p class=3D"">   Mary Winkler heard a &quot;boom&quot; but she said she d=
id not pull the trigger, prompting prosecutor Walt Freeland to ask her late=
r if she understood how a trigger worked.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;You kno=
w that pulling a trigger is what makes it go boom?&quot; Freeland asked.</p=
><p class=3D"">   &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Winkler replied. She said she remem=
bered holding the gun, but not getting it from the closet.</p><p class=3D""=
>   She said she just wanted to talk to her husband, Matthew, when she went=
 into their bedroom that day in March 2006, but she was too terrified. &quo=
t;He just could be so mean,&quot; she said.</p><p class=3D"">   But, she to=
ld Freeland, her husband did &quot;nothing&quot; for which he deserved to d=
ie.</p><p class=3D"">   Her depiction of her marriage contrasts radically w=
ith the description by the prosecution, whose witnesses described Winkler a=
s a good father and husband. The couple's 9-year-old daughter, Patricia, te=
stified that she never saw him mistreat her mother.</p><p class=3D"">   Win=
kler, 31, was fatally shot in the back. A day later, his wife was arrested =
on the Alabama coast 340 miles away, driving the family mini-van with her t=
hree young daughters inside.</p><p class=3D"">   Winkler said she planned t=
o return to Selmer but wanted time alone with her daughters. &quot;All I kn=
ew was that the stupid gun had went off, and nobody would believe me and th=
ey would just take my girls away from me,&quot; she said.</p><p class=3D"">=
   She said she still loved her husband.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;I was as=
hamed,&quot; she said, explaining why she told no one of the abuse. &quot;I=
 didn't want anybody to know about Matthew.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Winkl=
er testified her husband punched her in the face, kicked her at times and r=
efused to grant a divorce. Shortly after they were married, &quot;he just g=
ot me down and told me that I was his wife and we were family now, and he j=
ust screamed and hollered,&quot; she testified.</p><p class=3D"">   Speakin=
g about their sex life, she spoke quietly and hesitantly, with eyes downcas=
t. She said Matthew Winkler forced her to view pornography, dress &quot;slu=
tty&quot; and have sex she considered unnatural.</p><p class=3D"">   The de=
fense showed the jury a pair of white platform-heel shoes and a wig Winkler=
 said her husband wanted her to wear during sex. She described a skirt he w=
anted her to wear as &quot;very, very short.&quot; Pornographic photos she =
identified as coming from their home computer were entered as evidence.</p>=
<p class=3D"">   In his closing argument, defense attorney Steve Farese sai=
d the prosecution &quot;absolutely, positively&quot; did not prove Mary Win=
kler intended to kill her husband, something required for a conviction of f=
irst-degree murder. But Farese left open the possibility that she could be =
guilty of a lesser crime.</p><p class=3D"">   If convicted of first-degree =
murder, Winkler could be sentenced to up to 60 years in prison. Farese said=
 the judge would decide if the jury could consider lesser charges such as v=
oluntary manslaughter.</p><p class=3D"">   A psychologist testified Winkler=
 could not have formed the intent to commit a crime because of her compromi=
sed mental condition. She suffered from mild depression and post-traumatic =
stress disorder, which started at age 13 when her sister died and was worse=
ned by her husband's abuse, Dr. Lynn Zager said.</p><p class=3D"">   Last w=
eek, prosecutors played an audiotape in which Winkler told authorities that=
 her husband criticized her constantly and that she got tired of it and jus=
t &quot;snapped.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   The prosecution has also said Wi=
nkler was under stress because bank managers were closing in on a check-kit=
ing scheme she wanted to conceal from her husband. But Winkler said her hus=
band knew about the financial problems.</p><p class=3D"">   The jury will b=
egin deliberating Thursday, the judge said.</p>              <div class=3D"=

election over and new faces aligned with the union movement coming to the C=
ity Council, the chances of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. fulfilling its ambition of=
 expanding in Chicago appear to have suffered a blow.</p><p class=3D"">   B=
ut wait.</p><p class=3D"">   Wal-Mart's point man for Chicago, Roderick Sco=
tt, said Wednesday that the world's largest retailer is still actively look=
ing for more sites in the city despite the fact that the union-aligned memb=
ers of the council potentially have the clout to keep it at bay.  Wal-Mart =
opened its first Chicago store on the West Side last September.</p><p class=
=3D"">   The battle between those who see economic development in the arriv=
al of big-box retailers like Wal-Mart and those who see economic destructio=
n in its wage practices was gripping and hard- fought from the start. And t=
here appears to be no reason the great Wal-Mart debate won't continue.</p><=
p class=3D"">   &quot;What we have got to do now is meet with the new membe=
rs of the City Council to further determine how we can best serve our Chica=
go customers,&quot; said Scott.</p><p class=3D"">   The unions have been   =
 on one side of a dispute that could block Wal-Mart's expansion in the city=
. They are  supporting legislation that would force the company to  pay its=
 workers  more in wages and benefits. Wal-Mart has threatened not to expand=
 in Chicago if the legislation passes.</p><p class=3D"">   With at least fo=
ur more union-aligned aldermen joining the City Council, and Ald. Joe Moore=
 (49th) surviving a close runoff, it looks like labor won enough support in=
 Tuesday's election to continue the quest to pass a &quot;big-box&quot; ord=
inance that would set higher wage standards. Moore was the chief sponsor of=
 the ordinance that passed the City Council last summer, only to be vetoed =
by Mayor Richard Daley after three aldermen switched votes to support him.<=
/p><p class=3D"">   In Wal-Mart's favor is the fact that Ald. Howard Brooki=
ns (21st), who won a runoff against union-backed Leroy Jones, has been figh=
ting to get a Wal-Mart in his ward for three years.</p><p class=3D"">   Bro=
okins now thinks it's &quot;likely&quot; that Wal-Mart will come to his nei=
ghborhood. And Pat Dowell, the 3rd Ward candidate who unseated anti-big-box=
-ordinance Ald. Dorothy Tillman, has said publicly she favors retail develo=
pment.</p><p class=3D"">   Even Ald. Anthony Beale (9th), who  was not in t=
he runoff but who voted for the big-box ordinance last summer, is putting o=
ut the welcome mat for Wal-Mart to come into his South Side neighborhood.</=
p><p class=3D"">   It's no coincidence that Wal-Mart's first Chicago store =
opened on the West Side site of a former shampoo factory and the retailer i=
s looking at opening other sites on land that housed steel plants not long =
ago. Manufacturing jobs are disappearing in the Midwest and retail jobs are=
 on the rise.</p><p class=3D"">   Indeed, a site that  housed a state-of-th=
e art steel processing plant in the Chatham neighborhood in  Brookins' ward=
 is now home to a developing retail power center that could eventually incl=
ude a Wal- Mart.</p><p class=3D"">   Developer Archon Group LP, a unit of G=
oldman Sachs Group Inc., has already broken ground on a 420,000-square-foot=
 shopping center at 83rd Street and Stewart Avenue. A Lowe's home improveme=
nt store signed on as one anchor last month. Archon is searching for a seco=
nd anchor. Wal-Mart, which attempted to sign on to the project in 2004, is =
believed to still be interested in the site.</p><p class=3D"">   Neither Wa=
l-Mart's Scott nor officials at Archon would comment on Wal-Mart's  plans.<=
/p><p class=3D"">   &quot;I understand the whole issue of a living wage, bu=
t when you don't have any economic development taking place, you're looking=
 to see some,&quot; said Lorri Baldwin, president of the West Chatham Impro=
vement Association. &quot;I'd like to see a Wal-Mart come in. I have to dri=
ve to [the Burbank area] now to go to Wal-Mart. It would be a great opportu=
nity for our youth and seniors who would like to work part time.&quot;</p><=
p class=3D"">   Wal-Mart attempted to open a store in Chatham several years=
 ago but was prevented from doing so when the City Council voted against re=
zoning the manufacturing site for commercial use. In September 2004 the pro=
ject's developer, Monroe Investment Partners LLC, sent a letter to members =
of the City Council, including zoning committee chairman Ald. William Banks=
, stating that Wal-Mart was no longer involved in the project.</p><p class=
=3D"">   &quot;Wal-Mart is not now, and will not be, a part of our developm=
ent of the Ryerson site,&quot; the letter stated in bold type.</p><p class=
=3D"">   With Wal-Mart out of the picture, the letter paved the way for the=
 City Council to ultimately approve rezoning the site for commercial use. A=
rchon later took over the project, and Monroe stayed on as a joint venture =
partner.</p><p class=3D"">   ----------</p><p class=3D"">   <a href=3D"mail=

 BARTLETT</p><p class=3D"">   Long-range plan for corridor OKd</p><p class=
=3D"">   Village officials Tuesday night approved an amendment to Bartlett'=
s comprehensive plan that officials said is a model for future development.=
</p><p class=3D"">   The West Bartlett Road Corridor, a comprehensive desig=
n plan, will be used during the next five to 10 years to create what Jim Pl=
onczynski, community development director, called, &quot;an architecturally=
 pleasant landscape gateway&quot; into the downtown area of Bartlett.</p><p=
 class=3D"">   &quot;This plan covers landscape improvements, bike paths, f=
rontages and streetscapes and will serve as a blueprint for developers as p=
rojects come into the village,&quot; Plonczynski said. &quot;Usually when w=
e put these plans together, we're talking about long-range things that woul=
d take five to 10 years to complete.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   The corridor=
 runs from  Illinois Highway 25 on the west  to downtown on the east. Plonc=
zynski said the launching point of the project will be at the intersection =
of Naperville and West Bartlett Roads, where Cook County plans to widen the=
 intersection, and add traffic signals, turn lanes, a median and a bike pat=
h.</p><p class=3D"">   The new fire station that will be built at Spitzer a=
nd West Bartlett Roads will be one of the first Bartlett projects to come u=
nder the corridor plan.</p><p class=3D"">   David Sharos</p><p class=3D""> =
  - - -</p><p class=3D"">   HINSDALE</p><p class=3D"">   28 owners face wat=
er project fees</p><p class=3D"">   Hinsdale residents whose homes are slat=
ed for one of four local storm water projects have 60 days to derail villag=
e plans to make them pay 80 percent of the $372,000 total cost.</p><p class=
=3D"">   By state law, residents can force the village to abandon the propo=
sed charges -- if not the proposed drainage improvements -- by submitting a=
 petition signed by 51 percent of the property owners and 51 percent of the=
 voters registered as living at the affected homes.</p><p class=3D"">   The=
 28 affected properties are along Oak Street between 8th and 9th Streets; o=
n Briargate Terrace, Canterbury Court and The  Pines in the Fullersburg nei=
ghborhood; on Orchard Place and Oak Street near Chicago Avenue; and near th=
e intersection of Fuller Road and Elm Street. Assistant Village Manager Dou=
g Cooper said Tuesday night that affected property owners have been notifie=
d of the proposed charges.</p><p class=3D"">   Christine Martin</p><p class=
=3D"">   - - -</p><p class=3D"">   ITASCA</p><p class=3D"">   New ordinance=
 targets gang graffiti</p><p class=3D"">   In an effort to address possible=
 gang-related graffiti issues in Itasca, officials Tuesday night approved a=
 new ordinance to provide local police with guidelines regarding reporting =
of graffiti, its removal and possible fines.</p><p class=3D"">   Police Chi=
ef Scott Heher said that a number of villages in the area have adopted simi=
lar ordinances and that Itasca wanted &quot;to be proactive regarding graff=
iti issues.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;It's sort of like the broken wi=
ndow metaphor,&quot; Heher said. &quot;If you see one broken window somewhe=
re that's not repaired, before long, you'll have another. When graffiti rem=
ains visible, it sometimes leads to a game of one-upmanship, and we don't w=
ant that.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   The ordinance allows police to inform p=
roperty owners regarding graffiti on their building and to establish a time=
 limit for its removal. It also gives the village the right to remove the g=
raffiti and carries fines of $250 for the first incident of non-compliance =
to remove the markings to $500 for second offenses and beyond.</p><p class=
=3D"">   In a related matter, trustees also approved an amendment to an exi=
sting ordinance regarding Itasca's traffic code for penalties and violation=
s. Under the amendment, a local village prosecutor will be assigned to cour=
t cases rather than having them processed by the state's attorney's office.=

">   WARRENVILLE</p><p class=3D"">   Officials approve comprehensive plan</=
p><p class=3D"">   The new comprehensive plan adopted by Warrenville envisi=
ons a boulevard-style approach to Butterfield Road, new rowhouses in the ci=
vic center area and perhaps the rebirth of a popular dining spot.</p><p cla=
ss=3D"">   The plan, formally adopted Monday by the City Council, will guid=
e development in the Old Town and the civic center, and the main business a=
nd municipal areas in Warrenville.</p><p class=3D"">   Warrenville had cond=
ucted a year of community input and planning sessions to develop the plan, =
sparked by the council's 2005 rejection of a $14 million development.</p><p=
 class=3D"">   &quot;What we discussed after that was that we had no plan i=
n place for the downtown of our community,&quot; Mayor David Brummel said.<=
/p><p class=3D"">   What the city has now is a plan that calls for resident=
ial and mostly commercial development along Butterfield near Batavia Road. =

st any homeowner will tell you there's something they'd tweak if they could=
 about their home's design: more storage, a bigger kitchen or higher ceilin=
gs. The same holds true for property managers and others working with condo=
minium associations, who regularly spot ways that buildings could function =
better.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;Some designs are not completely thought o=
ut by the developer and the board is left holding the bag,&quot; said assoc=
iation consultant Shirley Feldman of Association Advocates in Chicago and P=
ark Ridge.</p><p class=3D"">   If security expert Vic Weisskopf built condo=
miniums, he would be sure to designate areas where packages are safe until =
owners can pick them up.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;You'd be amazed how many=
 very expensive buildings don't have anything like it,&quot; he said. &quot=
;Someone's Rolex watch could be sitting in the hallway in front of their do=
or.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;You'll find buildings with no place for a mai=
ntenance man to store his supplies,&quot; Weisskopf added. &quot;Sometimes =
you'll have a slop sink, but that's not enough. In Chicago, you at least ne=
ed space for a snow shovel if not a big snow blower.&quot;</p><p class=3D""=
>   Office space for maintenance and management personnel sometimes can be =
created in the garage, Feldman said.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;But then you=
've got people breathing car fumes, and you've got to have heating and cool=
ing and a phone line and where is that person going to go to the bathroom?&=
quot; she said.</p><p class=3D"">   Other quirks Feldman has noted include =
dog runs placed directly under resident balconies and a 200-unit building w=
ith storage for only a handful of bicycles.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;Somet=
imes the trash receptacles are located where other people in the neighborho=
od can use them and the association pays a huge bill for waste pickup that =
isn't theirs,&quot; she said.</p><p class=3D"">   There's never enough room=
 to put the snow, especially when it stacks up, said Sherm Fields, presiden=
t of Acres Group snow removal and landscaping company in Plainfield.</p><p =
class=3D"">   Some associations have so little unoccupied land that they pa=
y extra to transport their snow off-site, he said.</p><p class=3D"">   As f=
or landscaping, a common problem is too little diversity of plant material,=
 he said.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;Sometimes developers put in only a coup=
le of types of trees and shrubs, which makes the whole association more sus=
ceptible to disease and pests,&quot; he said. &quot;If one type is stricken=
, you lose a lot.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Civil engineer Kami Farahmandpo=
ur of Building Technology Consultants in Arlington Heights would like to se=
e Chicago's residential high-rises built for easier exterior maintenance. L=
ocal ordinance says the facades must be inspected every few years. The more=
 intricate the architectural detail, the more difficult and costly it is to=
 put up scaffolding to do the job.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;In many cases,=
 commercial buildings are designed with scaffolding davits that allow quick=
 installation of scaffolding equipment, thereby reducing costs,&quot; he sa=
id. &quot;Some even have built- in scaffolding equipment that is permanentl=
y mounted to rails on the roof. However, such equipment is rarely seen in r=
esidential community developments.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Beth Lloyd, pr=
esident of the Association of Condominium, Townhome and Homeowners Associat=
ions and a real estate broker for Coldwell Banker, has yet to unravel the m=
ysteries of association parking.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;Some condo build=
ings have outdoor parking lots that require you to walk halfway around the =
building to gain entrance,&quot; she said. &quot;And it would help to have =
addresses posted in large enough numbers, unobstructed by trees and posts, =
on several sides of the buildings.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Visitors and p=
rospective buyers appreciate clearly marked parking spaces, so they don't i=
nadvertently take someone else's, she said.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;Some =
associations use a code to identify the unit parking space for security rea=
sons,&quot; she said. &quot;That may be a good thing, but it's awful for ot=
hers to do the right thing if there is little or no visitor parking.&quot;<=
/p><p class=3D"">   Shared driveways, a growing trend in townhome communiti=
es, are a navigational challenge, she said.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;At ni=
ght it's very difficult to see which way the driveway turns,&quot; she said=
. &quot;This takes a toll on mailbox posts and street signs, not to mention=
 dents on cars and mangled landscape.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Parking bum=
pers placed too close to sidewalks is a pet peeve of property manager Erica=
 Horndasch of Legum &amp; Norman Mid-West in Glen Ellyn.</p><p class=3D""> =
  The tendency is for drivers to stop when their tires touch the bumper, an=
d the fronts of their cars hang over the sidewalk. Moving the bumpers furth=
er away from the sidewalk gives pedestrians more walking area and might pro=
vide space for shoveled snow, she said.</p>              <div class=3D""><d=

 ago it lost $92 million, or 49 cents a share. Revenue rose 1.6 percent, to=
 $5.43 billion, slightly below Wall Street's expectations.</p><p class=3D""=
>   The profit was American's first since 2000 in the first quarter, histor=
ically the weakest for the airline industry. Chairman and Chief Executive G=
erard Arpey said the results built on American's work in 2006, when it earn=
ed its first full-year profit after five money-losing years.</p><p class=3D=
"">   &quot;It was right on the money,&quot; said analyst Ray Neidl of Caly=
on Securities. &quot;The industry looks as if it's back on track.&quot;</p>=
<p class=3D"">   American's traffic rose 1.1 percent on international route=
s, compared with a 2.5 percent drop on domestic flights. The airline gets 3=
0 percent more revenue per square foot in business- and first- class cabins=
 of flights to Europe than in coach, according to Dan Garton, executive vic=
e president for marketing. American's jets averaged 78.1 percent occupancy =
in the quarter, up from 77.2 percent a year earlier.</p><p class=3D"">   St=
ock of the  airline's parent, AMR Corp., added $1.15, to $31.96, on the New=
 York Stock Exchange.</p><p class=3D"">   In other earnings news:</p><p cla=
ss=3D"">   -JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. reported a 55 percent jump in first- q=
uarter profit, reflecting strength across most of its primary business line=
s, though it increased reserves to offset subprime mortgage losses.</p><p c=
lass=3D"">   The New York-based bank said net income was $4.8 billion, or $=
1.34 a share, up from $3.1 billion, or 86 cents a share, a year earlier. Th=
e most recent results easily beat estimates of $1.02 a share. Revenue climb=
ed 25 percent, to nearly $19 billion.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;JPMorgan bl=
ew away even my expectations,&quot; said William Fitzpatrick, an analyst at=
 Johnson Asset Management in Racine, Wis.</p><p class=3D"">   The bank said=
 it was raising its quarterly dividend 4 cents, to 38 cents a share. It was=
 the first dividend increase in six years, said Chief Financial Officer Mic=
hael J. Cavanagh. The bank also authorized a $10 billion share repurchase p=
rogram.</p><p class=3D"">   Provision for credit losses rose $207 million, =
to $292 million, mostly because of higher losses in its subprime mortgage p=
ortfolio. Still, the bank called its exposure to the troubled subprime mark=
et, which involves home loans to high-risk borrowers, to be &quot;manageabl=
e.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Shares of JPMorgan gained $1.89, to $52.07, on=
 the NYSE.</p><p class=3D"">   -EBay Inc. said first-quarter net income cli=
mbed 52 percent, to $377.2 million, or 27 cents a share, from $248.3 millio=
n, or 17 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the San Jose, Cali=
f.- based online auction firm would have earned 33 cents a share, beating e=
stimates by 3 cents a share. Revenue increased 27 percent, to $1.77 billion=
.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;They're still the gorilla,&quot; said Rachel Wa=
kefield, a portfolio manager for Coldstream Capital Management in Portland,=
 Ore. &quot;I just don't see anywhere else the sellers can go in spite of t=
he price hike.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Auction revenue per listing rose 2=
0 percent from a year earlier, helped by a fee increase. Overseas revenue s=
urged 38 percent, outpacing an 18 percent gain in the U.S.</p><p class=3D""=

your pets off in style is hardly a modern idea: Last year, researchers unco=
vered a 1,000-year-old pet cemetery near Lima, Peru, where 43 mummified dog=
s had been buried with treats alongside their pre-Incan owners. Here are so=
me of the ways today's animal caretakers can deal with their companions' de=
aths:</p><p class=3D"">   * Pet funerals: Pet funeral homes offer everythin=
g from pre-need planning to viewings and visitations. If you prefer a resti=
ng place in cyberspace, look on the Web at <a href=3D"http://virtualpetceme=
tery.org" class=3D"">virtualpetcemetery.org</a>, in-memory- <a href=3D"http=
://of-pets.com" class=3D"">of-pets.com</a> and <a href=3D"http://rainbowbri=
dge.com" class=3D"">rainbowbridge.com</a>.</p><p class=3D"">   * Urns and m=
emorials: A metal canister on the mantel is no longer your only choice for =
a cremated animal's ashes. Web sites offer other options, such as the penda=
nts shaped like bones or balls of yarn (left) found at <a href=3D"http://al=
laboutpeturns.com" class=3D"">allaboutpeturns.com</a>. Two more sites are <=
a href=3D"http://custompeturns.com" class=3D"">custompeturns.com</a> and <a=
 href=3D"http://lucythewonderdog.com" class=3D"">lucythewonderdog.com</a>.<=
/p><p class=3D"">   * Pet preservation: Companies such as Mansfield's Pet P=
reservation Specialist (<a href=3D"http://petpreservations.com" class=3D"">=
petpreservations.com</a>) can freeze-dry your companion in any desired posi=
tion. The process takes about four months, and a good-size German shepherd =
costs about $1,500.</p><p class=3D"">   * DNA banking: You can bank your ki=
tty or doggie or hamster DNA in liquid nitrogen at a facility such as a Via=
gen (<a href=3D"http://viagen.com" class=3D"">viagen.com</a>), but just rem=
ember: Variations in environment can produce genetically identical animals =
during cloning that behave differently and sometimes even look different. [=

p class=3D"">   Most bands post music online in hopes that their work will =
fall on interested ears. With a bit of talent, a group of newcomers can acc=
umulate a sizeable fan base in a matter of months, or even weeks.</p><p cla=
ss=3D"">   This strategy certainly worked for suburban Chicago rockers Blac=
ktop Mourning.</p><p class=3D"">   How their music reached new fans is noth=
ing new. Whom their music reached is a bit less ordinary. Shortly after pos=
ting songs on MySpace in late 2005, the band was contacted by MTV.</p><p cl=
ass=3D"">   &quot;We really thought it was a prank,&quot; said guitarist an=
d songwriter Max Steger, 18 of Bannockburn. The call was not a joke, and th=
e group soon signed a deal with MTV that landed its songs on several of the=
 network's shows, including &quot;Pimp My Ride.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   B=
y then, Blacktop's MySpace page was receiving a bit more traffic, and one o=
f the band's new fans turned out to be Adam Duritz of the Counting Crows.</=
p><p class=3D"">   &quot;We heard Adam liked our music shortly after we put=
 it on MySpace,&quot; Steger said.</p><p class=3D"">   The group was asked =
to meet with Duritz when the Crows came to the First Midwest Bank Amphithea=
tre in August, and they ended up having an amazing time.</p><p class=3D""> =
  &quot;It was an incredible night,&quot; Steger said. &quot;We really hit =
it off with him.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   That night, the band and Duritz =
discussed plans to record in California when Duritz finished touring. A cou=
ple of months later, the band had signed with Duritz' new label, Tyrannosau=
rus Records. Steger and vocalist Joe Levand, 21, of Park Ridge headed to Be=
rkeley, Calif., to record with Duritz and Crows guitarist David Immergluck.=
 The result is Blacktop Mourning's upcoming album, &quot;No Regrets,&quot; =
which drops May 15.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;Adam really had a take on my =
songs that brought another dimension to them,&quot; Steger said of the reco=
rding process. &quot;We had a lot of creative discussion and a lot of laugh=
s.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Hear &quot;Halfway to Midnight&quot; from Blac=

=3D"">   Mark Silverman laid out Wednesday all the goodies the new Big Ten =
Network has to offer.</p><p class=3D"">   The network president talked abou=
t a daily news-and-feature studio show -- a Big Ten &quot;SportsCenter,&quo=
t; if you will -- plus live reports from each campus, coach's shows and reb=
roadcasts of classic games. The centerpiece will be a slew of live games, i=
ncluding 35 in football and 105 in basketball.</p><p class=3D"">   If you t=
hink  the Big Ten Network is going to get stuck with dumpy games, guess aga=
in. In football ABC still will get the first pick, but there will be many w=
eeks when the Big Ten Network will have the second or third selection over =
ESPN and ESPN2.</p><p class=3D"">   It will be all Big Ten, all the time. N=
irvana, if you can't get enough of the Illini, Wildcats, Buckeyes, Wolverin=
es, etc.</p><p class=3D"">   But there's a big question: Who will be able t=
o see the Big Ten Network when it launches in August?</p><p class=3D"">   S=
ilverman said the network is in the process of negotiating deals with the v=
arious cable and satellite outlets. DirecTV already has agreed to carry the=
 network on its Total Choice package. Some small cable companies also have =
signed on, he said.</p><p class=3D"">   But much work needs to be done in s=
ecuring the bigger systems, including Comcast, the major cable carrier in t=
he Chicago area.</p><p class=3D"">   Silverman said repeatedly he is &quot;=
very confident all the deals will get done.&quot; But it hardly is a slam d=
unk given the distribution problems NFL Network and the Major League Baseba=
ll &quot;Extra Innings&quot; package recently have encountered.</p><p class=
=3D"">   The Big Ten's goal is to be on expanded basic cable on all the sys=
tems within the eight states that make up the conference; 18.1 million home=
s have cable or satellite in the region. It would appear on the digital pla=
tform elsewhere.</p><p class=3D"">   According to Sports Business Journal, =
the network is asking cable providers to pay $1.10 per subscriber in the Bi=
g Ten area. That price is said to have major cable companies balking.</p><p=
 class=3D"">   The cable operators don't want to pass on additional fees to=
 their customers. While ESPN charges $3 per subscriber, NFL Network receive=
s only 70 cents per subscriber. Somebody is going to have pay the $1.10 per=
 subscriber the Big Ten is seeking.</p><p class=3D"">   There is another po=
tential stumbling block. Many major cable companies often say they don't ha=
ve room on their basic tiers to add another channel. NFL Network runs on Co=
mcast's digital tier in the Chicago area, even though it is airing regular-=
season NFL games.</p><p class=3D"">   Silverman wouldn't comment on the spe=
cifics of the pending talks.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;We plan on negotiati=
ng behind closed doors,&quot; Silverman said. &quot;We've had encouraging c=
onversations. We don't plan on having any discontent.&quot;</p><p class=3D"=
">   Silverman has reason to be optimistic now because he still is relative=
ly early in the negotiating process. But things could get heated if deals a=
ren't reached before August.</p><p class=3D"">   NFL Network went on a camp=
aign last fall to apply pressure on several large holdouts to add the chann=
el to their systems. There were areas in Wisconsin that couldn't get the Pa=
ckers-Vikings game in December because their cable outlets didn't carry NFL=
 Network.</p><p class=3D"">   The Big Ten Network obviously hopes to avoid =
that situation. But if there is trouble, it holds a fairly strong trump car=
d: the fans. Big Ten fans are passionate and they want it all.</p><p class=
=3D"">   Imagine a cable operator in Columbus not carrying the Big Ten Netw=
ork on its system, thus forcing local fans to miss an Ohio State- Iowa foot=
ball game. The reaction wouldn't be pretty.</p><p class=3D"">   Public pres=
sure can be a beautiful thing. It recently forced MLB to cut a deal with th=
e cable companies to add the &quot;Extra Innings&quot; package. Initially b=
aseball had wanted to do an exclusive deal with DirecTV.</p><p class=3D""> =
  Unless the Big Ten Network reaches agreements soon with the major cable p=
roviders, the negotiations will be a storyline through the summer. Usually =
these things have a way of getting worked out, but as the NFL Network has s=
hown, there are no guarantees.</p><p class=3D"">   If August comes around a=
nd you aren't receiving the Big Ten Network on your system, you know what t=
o do. Get on the phone to your cable provider and blast your school's fight=
 song in its ear.</p><p class=3D"">   ---------</p><p class=3D"">   <a href=

           </text></p><div class=3D""><p class=3D"">   Motorola Inc. on Wed=
nesday reported its first quarterly loss in 2 1/2 years, unveiled a big los=
s in its global cell phone market share and signaled that the second quarte=
r isn't going to be much better.</p><p class=3D"">   Still, investors pushe=
d the beleaguered company's stock up a bit, apparently seeing hints of a tu=
rnaround, or maybe just breathing a sigh of relief because news from the ce=
ll phone giant wasn't as bad as some expected.</p><p class=3D"">   Schaumbu=
rg-based Motorola  maintained Wednesday that a reversal of fortunes is on t=
ap in 2007's second half. Several stock analysts remain skeptical. &quot;I =
think that's extremely challenging,&quot; said Brant Thompson, an analyst a=
t Goldman Sachs. &quot;They just have some really tough sledding.&quot;</p>=
<p class=3D"">   Motorola's woes have led some observers to speculate that =
Edward Zander may not be all that secure in his position as  chief executiv=
e.</p><p class=3D"">   But Wednesday, a Motorola director said in an interv=
iew with the Tribune that the board is solidly behind Zander, with no incli=
nation to give him the ax.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;In the context of [bei=
ng] a board member, I can tell you Ed has unanimous support,&quot; said Tho=
mas Meredith, who is also acting chief financial officer. Zander, Meredith =
added, has &quot;created huge value for shareholders during his tenure.&quo=
t;</p><p class=3D"">   Zander and Motorola rode the rise of the Razr cell p=
hone well into 2006, with Motorola's stock peaking around $26 last October,=
  nearly $13 more than when Zander took over in January 2004. But since las=
t fall, the Razr has become a commodity, and Motorola is faced with a pauci=
ty of compelling high-end phones -- the kind that command higher prices and=
 higher profits.</p><p class=3D"">   Motorola rocked Wall Street in early J=
anuary by announcing its phone division's fourth-quarter profits would fall=
 well short of forecasts. Then, on March 21, Motorola warned that its rapid=
ly decaying phone business would cause the firm to actually lose money duri=
ng 2007's first quarter.</p><p class=3D"">   On the heels of the bad fourth=
 quarter, New York-based maverick financier Carl Icahn announced he was  se=
eking a seat on Motorola's board -- much to management's displeasure.</p><p=
 class=3D"">   Now one of Motorola's largest stockholders, Icahn has since =
upped his pressure on Motorola. Wednesday, in a second letter to Motorola s=
hareholders, he said that the company's earnings conference call &quot;reaf=
firmed my belief that Motorola has a passive and reactive board.&quot;</p><=
p class=3D"">   The company has defended its board as being highly engaged =
in the firm's operations.</p><p class=3D"">   Motorola on Wednesday reporte=
d a net loss of $181 million, or 9 cents per share, including charges of 11=
 cents per share for one- time items. Those results were in line with Motor=
ola's warning  March 21 that its cell phone operation was bleeding red ink.=
 The company's total quarterly sales of $9.4 billion were a bit above forec=
ast.</p><p class=3D"">   Motorola's strategy shift this winter -- it won't =
chase cell phone market share if it's not profitable -- was borne out in it=
s first-quarter report Wednesday.</p><p class=3D"">   Motorola, the world's=
 second-largest cell phone-maker, estimates that its slice of the global ma=
rket will be 17.5 percent, down from at least 22.1 percent during the fourt=
h quarter, and the lowest in 21 months.</p><p class=3D"">   The pursuit of =
&quot;market share at all costs,&quot; Zander told analysts in a conference=
 call Wednesday, &quot;in retrospect, that was our big error in judgment.&q=
uot;</p><p class=3D"">   But there's potentially a cost, some analysts say,=
 to giving up market share -- even if it's unprofitable in the short term.<=
/p><p class=3D"">   Under Ron Garriques, head of Motorola's cell-phone divi=
sion until he left abruptly for another job in February, Motorola operated =
under the idea that retaining market share was necessary, even during a dow=
n cycle, Citigroup analyst Daryl Armstrong said in a recent interview.</p><=
p class=3D"">   Garriques' idea was that &quot;shelf space&quot; had to be =
maintained until the arrival of the next hit products, Armstrong said, unde=
r the rationale that building back lost market share costs three times as m=
uch as it cost to win it in the first place, Armstrong said.</p><p class=3D=
"">   It's a conundrum. &quot;I can see where Zander is coming from,&quot; =
Armstrong said, in that there's certainly logic in not pursuing market shar=
e at the expense of profits. But if Garriques' theory is right, Motorola co=
uld get &quot;the worst of both worlds&quot; -- lower share, without higher=
 profits.</p><p class=3D"">   In reaction to Wednesday's earnings report, i=
nvestors bid up Motorola's stock by 27 cents, or 1.5 percent, to close at $=
18.22.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;The [first-quarter report] wasn't as bad a=
s people feared it would be,&quot; said James Faucette, a stock analyst at =
Pacific Crest Securities. Or as Brian Modoff, an analyst at Deutsche Bank S=
ecurities put it, &quot;People are thinking the worst is over.&quot;</p><p =
class=3D"">   Motorola reiterated Wednesday that it expects its cell-phone =
operation to start gradually improving during the second half of 2007 and t=
urn a profit for the whole year.</p><p class=3D"">   Yet Modoff, like sever=
al other analysts, has his doubts, saying he expects Motorola's cell-phone =
division to lose money through the third quarter and only break even in the=
 fourth.</p><p class=3D"">   The company anticipates that new models will h=
elp refresh what analysts say is a tired phone lineup. Cost cutting will he=
lp too. Motorola announced in January it planned to slash 3,500 jobs, resul=
ting in $400 million in savings. Company executives Wednesday said more cos=
t-cutting moves may be announced by June 1.</p><p class=3D"">   ----------<=

ass=3D"">   A gate at  Naval Station Great Lakes that North Chicago officia=
ls were counting on to help revive a blighted business district will remain=
 closed, a spokeswoman for the base said this week.</p><p class=3D"">   The=
 base entrance fronting the new  King Drive crossing of the Union Pacific r=
ailroad tracks will  open only for special occasions, and the main gate abo=
ut a mile south will continue to be the principal entrance and exit for the=
 base, Lt. Cmdr. Melissa Scheuermann said.</p><p class=3D"">   The city and=
 the federal government are spending about $6 million to rebuild the King D=
rive-Sheridan Road intersection and railroad crossing. The city has bought =
most of the property along Sheridan  near Great Lakes and is planning a mas=
sive commercial development called Sheridan Crossing on 40 acres across the=
 tracks from the naval base exit known as Gate 4.</p><p class=3D"">   The c=
ity was counting on the opening of Gate 4 to make it easier for thousands o=
f sailors and civilian federal workers to reach the Sheridan Crossing devel=
opment.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;It's very disappointing,&quot; North Chic=
ago Mayor Leon Rockingham Jr. said. &quot;My understanding was that the gat=
e would be open. If we had known it was going to be closed, we might not ha=
ve gone forward with the [intersection] project.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   =
Rockingham said the Navy's decision was revealed about two weeks ago during=
 engineering discussions about the opening of the intersection.</p><p class=
=3D"">   Project stakeholders want &quot;to bridge the gap between the Navy=
 base and the city of North Chicago,&quot; Rockingham said in a letter this=
 week to U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.). &quot;Regrettably, the Navy does not=
 share in that vision and will not commit to the opening of Gate 4. ... The=
 city's [Sheridan Crossing] project is in grave risk.&quot;</p><p class=3D"=
">   Taverns, restaurants, tattoo parlors, jewelry shops and businesses cat=
ering to sailors howled in protest when the King Drive track crossing to Gr=
eat Lakes was closed and Gate 4 traffic was restricted in 1990. The gaudy b=
ut thriving Sheridan Road &quot;Strip&quot; across the tracks from Great La=
kes went into a decline over the next decade.</p><p class=3D"">   Six years=
 ago, Adm. David Polatty, former base commander, vowed that the road would =
be reopened and suggested Gate 4 -- once a main exit for sailors seeking ac=
cess to the Strip -- would be opened too.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;Gate 4 =
was never conceptually designed to be a main gate,&quot; Scheuermann said. =
&quot;It was designed to be an alternate gate. ... It has only two lanes.&q=
uot;</p><p class=3D"">   In addition, there is no funding available for mor=
e security personnel if Gate 4 were  reopened, she said. Private security s=
ervices are used at the base's entrances, she said.</p><p class=3D"">   &qu=
ot;There is no reason to open it,&quot; Scheuermann said.</p><p class=3D"">=
   Said Kirk: &quot;This is not what the senior Pentagon leadership agreed =
to. We will have to reverse this.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   The opening of =
Gate 4 &quot;is critical to North Chicago,&quot; Kirk said.</p><p class=3D"=
">   &quot;The whole point of $5.5 million in federal money [for gate and i=
ntersection reconstruction work] was to open that gate and start a flow of =
traffic to the main corridor in North Chicago. We have the new African-Amer=
ican veterans memorial there, the new bank, Sheridan Crossing. All these pr=
ojects depend on the gate opening. The key to restarting the business clima=
te is commuter traffic.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   North Chicago will go for=
ward with the Sheridan Crossing project whether Gate 4 is open or closed, R=
ockingham said.</p><p class=3D""> Credit: By Ralph Zahorik, Special to the =

   Consumer advocates have begun criticizing major mortgage lenders, such a=
s Countrywide Financial Corp. and GMAC Financial, that also have in-house f=
oreclosure businesses.</p><p class=3D"">   It is &quot;mind-boggling&quot; =
that in many states people can lose their homes in foreclosure without any =
court hearing and that the foreclosure is done by a company with ties to th=
e lender, says Ira Rheingold, general counsel for the National Association =
of Consumer Advocates.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;They should be completely =
objective and not have any financial interest in how the case is resolved,&=
quot; Rheingold added.</p><p class=3D"">   Bert Ely, a banking industry con=
sultant in Alexandria, Va., disagreed, saying lenders  want to prevent fore=
closures. If  one must take place, he said, lenders want it to proceed quic=
kly and inexpensively.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;No legitimate lender wants=
 to foreclose, and the reason why is that the losses are very substantial,&=
quot; he said. &quot;Foreclosure is not a profitable activity, let me assur=
e you.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Foreclosure is so costly to lenders -- on =
average, they recoup about two-thirds of a home's value -- that they should=
 be able to foreclose using their own staff rather than having to hire outs=
ide attorneys, Ely said.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;The banks should be allo=
wed to do it the cheapest way possible,&quot; Ely said.</p><p class=3D"">  =
 Yet, as interest rates and the foreclosure rate continue to rise, federal =
and state lawmakers and policymakers could be asked to scrutinize the vastl=
y different foreclosure processes nationwide.</p><p class=3D"">   In 30 sta=
tes consumers can have their case heard by a judge. In the other 20 states =
non-judicial &quot;trustees&quot; generally oversee foreclosures, but state=
 laws vary as to who can act as a trustee.</p><p class=3D"">   In some stat=
es the foreclosure company can serve as trustee.</p><p class=3D"">   Philli=
p Adleson, corporate counsel for the United Trustees Association, a Califor=
nia-based group of independent and in-house trustees, said there is no fact=
ual data to show that borrowers are worse off when a bank handles a foreclo=
sure.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;Particularly in states like California, non=
-judicial foreclosures are highly regulated, leaving little discretion to t=
he trustee,&quot; Adleson said. There is no evidence that banks with in- ho=
use trustees are more likely to foreclose than independent trustees, he add=
ed.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;In fact, the last thing most institutional le=
nders want to do is to acquire&quot; foreclosed properties, he said.</p><p =
class=3D"">   David Berenbaum, executive vice president of the National Com=
munity Reinvestment Coalition, a housing advocacy group, said many large le=
nders are trying to reduce costs by getting into parts of the mortgage busi=
ness that have traditionally been run by third parties.</p><p class=3D""> C=

         </text></p><div class=3D""><p class=3D"">   A Senate committee cha=
irman said Tuesday that Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. has &quot;a steep hill =
to climb&quot; in showing that its proposed purchase of XM Satellite Radio =
Holdings Inc. will not hurt competition in the audio entertainment market.<=
/p><p class=3D"">   Sirius Chief Executive Mel Karmazin told members of the=
 Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee that a combined sate=
llite radio provider would benefit consumers by letting them access both co=
mpanies' services for a diminished price.</p><p class=3D"">   Both companie=
s currently have subscription fees of $12.95. Karmazin said a merged compan=
y would be able to provide both companies' programming on one &quot;interop=
erable&quot; radio for less than the $25.90 it would currently cost to subs=
cribe to both services.</p><p class=3D"">   The combined company would cons=
ider offering regulators a guarantee that they would not raise prices in or=
der to complete the merger, Karmazin said.</p><p class=3D"">   Sirius' prop=
osed buyout faces significant regulatory hurdles. The Federal Communication=
s Commission granted licenses to the two companies in 1997 on the condition=
 that they would never merge to create a potential satellite radio monopoly=
.</p><p class=3D"">   But Karmazin argues that new technology has evolved d=
uring the past 10 years to provide them with significant competition in the=
 form of high-definition radio, online radio and even iPods.</p><p class=3D=
"">   &quot;The audio entertainment market is robust, competitive and teami=
ng with innovation and will remain so after our merger,&quot; Karmazin said=
.</p><p class=3D"">   Karmazin received a cool response to this argument fr=
om Democratic senators, including committee Chairman Daniel Inouye (D- Hawa=
ii).</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;Given the public interest in promoting compe=
tition and maximizing a diversity of media outlets, we should be skeptical =
of claims that new technologies necessarily 'change the equation' and provi=
de competition sufficient to restrain monopoly power,&quot; Inouye said.</p=
><p class=3D"">   Karmazin, who previously headed CBS Radio, walked a thin =
line in his testimony between affirming the profitability of satellite radi=
o while drawing attention to the financial challenges both providers have f=
aced.</p><p class=3D"">   After investing more than $5 billion in each of t=
heir businesses, Sirius and XM reported operating losses last year of $1.1 =
billion and $719 million, respectively.</p><p class=3D"">   Some lawmakers =
questioned the rationale for the proposed merger after Karmazin said that b=
oth companies would still be able to prosper if they do not combine forces.=
</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;You are saying both companies are in pretty good=
 shape and you believe both companies are in position to achieve profitabil=
ity,&quot; said Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.). &quot;That is not what provokes=
 a merger.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   RBC Analyst David Bank agreed that sat=
ellite radio will remain a viable business without the merger, but he said =
both companies, and their shareholders, would benefit even more from joinin=
g forces.</p>              <div class=3D""><div class=3D""><strong xmlns:xl=

ement of the Lollapalooza lineup and this week's release of Ravinia tickets=
 (online sales begin Thursday) has us ready to move our concertgoing to sun=
nier settings. Here are some of the best acts to catch outdoors this summer=
, whether you're looking to get rowdy or just sit back and relax.</p><p cla=
ss=3D"">   For tireless rockers</p><p class=3D"">   If summer breezes fire =
you up instead of cool you down, head to Northerly Island's Charter One Pav=
ilion on June 10 and 11 for mega- popular Chicago rockers Fall Out Boy ($35=
). Keep the adrenaline flowing July 28 when Coheed and Cambria, Hawthorne H=
eights and Bad Religion headline the Vans Warped Tour ($13.99-$27.25) at Fi=
rst Midwest Bank Amphitheatre. If you need a rest after that all-day music =
marathon, well, we'll understand.</p><p class=3D"">   For laid-back cats</p=
><p class=3D"">   Two words: stress relief. For summer relaxation, you can'=
t beat a spot on the lawn for Nickel Creek's Aug. 10 show at Ravinia ($15; =
pavilion seats $45). With their bluegrass rhythms, the folk trio provides t=
unes to get your mind off the 9-to-5. If you need to be soothed sooner, Joh=
n Mayer (above) appears at Charter One Pavilion on June 28 and 29 ($35.50-$=
55.50). His latest, Grammy-winning &quot;Continuum&quot; is like a massage =
for your ears.</p><p class=3D"">   For couch potatoes</p><p class=3D"">   Y=
ou resisted at first. But after about 3 billion listens to the TV-friendly =
&quot;How to Save a Life&quot; (featured on &quot;Grey's Anatomy,&quot; &qu=
ot;Scrubs&quot; and &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; and also used in HBO ads) you=
've accepted that pop-rockers The Fray (above) are here to stay. Pull yours=
elf away from the tube and see the band June 12-14 at Northerly Island's Ch=
arter One Pavilion. $35.50. Looking for a &quot;Sweet Escape&quot; a week e=
arlier? Head to First Midwest Bank Amphitheatre June 8 to see pop star and =
recent &quot;American Idol&quot; guest Gwen Stefani ($25- $69.50).</p><p cl=
ass=3D"">   For global thinkers</p><p class=3D"">   So you like quintessent=
ial American artists (Bruce Springsteen, yes; John Mellencamp, not anymore)=
 but enjoy expanding your palate once in awhile? Ravinia's got you covered.=
 Don't miss Brazilian singer-guitarist Seu Jorge -- still best known in the=
 U.S. for his role in &quot;The Life Aquatic&quot; -- June 17. Return two m=
onths later (Aug. 17 and 18) for France's Gipsy Kings (above), still making=
 hips move after more than two decades. Lawn seats for either show: $15.</p=
><p class=3D"">   For advance planners</p><p class=3D"">   There's no place=
 for procrastination when it comes to hot tickets. Hopefully, you already s=
nagged seats for The Police's sold- out shows at Wrigley Field (July 5 and =
6) and the Crossroads Guitar Festival (July 28) at Toyota Park, featuring E=
ric Clapton (above), B.B. King and Sheryl Crow. Tickets weren't available l=
ong for the guitar extravaganza, and both Police shows sold out faster than=
 you can say, &quot;Hey, Sting looks pretty good for 55.&quot;</p><p class=

              </text></p><div class=3D""><p class=3D"">   Shares of Norther=
n Trust Corp. hit a 52-week high Tuesday after it reported a significantly =
stronger-than-expected 15 percent jump in first-quarter earnings.</p><p cla=
ss=3D"">   The Chicago-based bank, which also held its annual shareholders =
meeting, said net income was a record $186.7 million, or 84 cents a diluted=
 share, up from $163 million, or 74 cents a share, in the year-ago period.<=
/p><p class=3D"">   The most recent results easily topped the 79-cent-a-sha=
re performance that analysts had been expecting. Northern noted that it mad=
e no provision for loan losses in the latest quarter. The year- ago earning=
s included a $4 million set-aside for such losses.</p><p class=3D"">   Nort=
hern specializes in providing private banking services to wealthy clients, =
and it also offers asset-management services to corporate and institutional=
 clients.</p><p class=3D"">   In the first quarter, income from trust, inve=
stment and other servicing fees rose 10 percent, to $488.9 million, the com=
pany said. Foreign-exchange trading climbed a hefty 20 percent, to $67.2 mi=
llion. Altogether, non-interest income rose 8 percent, to $613.5 million.</=
p><p class=3D"">   Net interest income -- that is, profit from Northern's l=
ending activities -- increased 10 percent, to $210.3 million.</p><p class=
=3D"">   Northern's latest earnings got some help from a lower income-tax r=
ate. While pretax earnings were up 13 percent, the company's income- tax pa=
yments rose only 9 percent, which contributed to the 15 percent upturn in n=
et income.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;We are pleased with our performance in=
 the quarter, particularly with the accelerated growth in our private clien=
t business,&quot; said Chairman and Chief Executive William Osborn.</p><p c=
lass=3D"">   Despite some serious consolidation in the sector in the last y=
ear, with Bank of America Corp.'s proposed merger with U.S. Trust Corp., an=
d Bank of New York Co.'s pending purchase of Mellon Financial Corp., Osborn=
 said Northern's &quot;directors, employees and clients see no reason we sh=
ould become part of another company.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;We hav=
e a very strong growth record,&quot; he said &quot;We plan to say independe=
nt as long as we can continue to do well for our shareholders.&quot;</p><p =
class=3D"">   Northern's loss as an independent company would be another bl=
ow to Chicago's standing in the financial world. Headquartered on LaSalle S=
treet, in the heart of the city's financial district, Northern is among the=
 last remaining sizable publicly traded financial-services businesses based=
 in the Chicago area. Chicago's three biggest banks, for example, are owned=
 by out-of-towners.</p><p class=3D"">   Osborn also was asked if Northern f=
eels any pressure to make a big acquisition itself.</p><p class=3D"">   &qu=
ot;Two years ago, we bought the financial-services group of Baring for $500=
 million, and we'll continue to make targeted acquisitions to improve our a=
bility to serve our clients,&quot; he said.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;But w=
e're in a position where we don't have to do things unless it makes sense. =
We're not ones who think that being big for big's sake is the right answer.=
&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   One shareholder asked Osborn why Northern doesn'=
t do a better job rewarding investors by hiking its dividend and pointed ou=
t that over a five-year period Northern's stock has underperformed its peer=
 group.</p><p class=3D"">   Osborn replied that Northern's stock price rose=
 17 percent in 2006, and he said the company typically returns 60 percent t=
o 65 percent of its earnings to shareholders through dividends and share re=
purchases.</p><p class=3D"">   Why doesn't it do more, he was asked.</p><p =
class=3D"">   &quot;We're investing in the business,&quot; Osborn said, not=
ing that technology spending during the next three years will be $1.1 billi=
on to $1.2 billion, an increase of $100 million to $150 million over the pr=
evious three-year period.</p><p class=3D"">   Northern stock added $1.73, o=
r 2.8 percent, to $64.28, on the Nasdaq stock market.</p><p class=3D"">   I=
n other earnings news:</p><p class=3D"">   *Packaging Corp. of America said=
 first-quarter net income rose almost threefold, to $31.2 million, or 30 ce=
nts a share, from $10.9 million, or 10 cents a share, a year ago.</p><p cla=
ss=3D"">   The Lake Forest-based maker of containerboard and corrugated pac=
kaging said revenue rose 10 percent, to $559.2 million. The report came out=
 after the close of trading.</p><p class=3D"">   ----------</p><p class=3D"=

aSalle Bank, agreed to extend exclusive takeover discussions with Barclays =
PLC through the end of the week and said it will meet with a rival bidding =
group led by Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC.</p><p class=3D"">   Barclays=
 set some initial terms on March 20 to buy ABN in what would be the world's=
 largest financial-services acquisition. &quot;There can be no certainty th=

panies said in a joint statement Tuesday.</p><p class=3D"">   Analysts said=
 speculation about a competing bid might have lifted ABN shares beyond the =
reach of Barclays. ABN has agreed to sit down with Royal Bank executives in=
 Amsterdam next week.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;It means they don't know wh=

ollar reached a dubious milestone Tuesday, as a British pound bought more t=
han $2 for the first time in nearly 15 years.</p><p class=3D"">   That mean=
s you'll probably hear more British accents in downtown Chicago this summer=
. Combined with dollar weakness against the euro, it's too bad for Chicago'=
s tourism industry that the Olympics won't be staged here this year.</p><p =
class=3D"">   U.S. investors who hold international mutual funds can count =
themselves among the winners. Stronger foreign currencies buy more dollar-b=
ased investment returns. The iShares United Kingdom exchange- traded fund, =
for example, is up 7.4 percent this year, compared with a 4.2 percent gain =
for the iShares S&amp;P 500 index.</p><p class=3D"">   Amid uniformly benig=
n financial conditions around the world, traders seeking an edge accentuate=
 every difference between investment factors. On Tuesday, the spotlight fel=
l on inflation; in particular, on the inflation comparison between the Unit=
ed States and Great Britain.</p><p class=3D"">   Here, the Labor Department=
 reported that so-called core inflation, not counting food and energy price=
s, eased last month from strong showings in January and February. On an ann=
ual basis, the U.S. consumer price index, including food and energy, is cli=
mbing at about a 2.8 percent rate, well below the 3.4 percent rate of a yea=
r ago.</p><p class=3D"">   Across the pond, the latest British inflation re=
port shows a 3.1 percent rate, the steepest inflation there in 10 years. In=
flation comparisons such as these help convince analysts that the Bank of E=
ngland is more likely to raise interest rates than the U.S. Federal Reserve=
. Higher rates attract traders into a currency.</p><p class=3D"">   But it =
is easy to overstate comparisons of routine economic data, which can fluctu=
ate day by day. International Monetary Fund statistics indicate that inflat=
ion is under control in all major countries.</p><p class=3D"">   Here are a=
 few examples. Inflation in Australia declined to an estimated 2.8 percent =
this year from 4.5 percent in 2000. Inflation in Ireland eased to an estima=
ted 2.4 percent this year from 5.2 percent in 2000. IMF forecasts for 2008 =
show inflation edging higher in several countries, including the United Sta=
tes, but there is no sign of serious inflation anywhere among the world's m=
ajor trading partners.</p><p class=3D"">   The persistent weakness of the d=
ollar must reflect something else. John Brady, senior vice president at Man=
 Financial, said the principal difference is economic growth.</p><p class=
=3D"">   &quot;We are in a global deflationary environment, and because the=
 U.S. imports so much, especially in terms of labor costs, the trend is bei=
ng maintained,&quot; he said.</p><p class=3D"">   Wage inflation is absent =
in most of the world, he said. On the other hand, &quot;the tone and struct=
ure of European growth is impressive,&quot; he said.</p><p class=3D"">   Br=
ady said petrodollars from the Middle East are being recycled to Europe and=
 Britain, not to the U.S.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;Some of that may be a p=
olitical statement; some of it may not be,&quot; he said. But &quot;that ex=
plains the strength of their currencies and helps explain the differentials=
 in interest rates.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   The money supply is booming i=
n Europe, Brady said.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;You're seeing a lot more in=
vestment going into Europe,&quot; he said. &quot;The European money supply =
figures have shown tremendous velocity.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   ---------=

><p class=3D"">   The governor was critically injured when the vehicle cras=
hed into a guardrail on the Garden State Parkway just north of Atlantic Cit=
y last week. He apparently was not wearing his seat belt in the front passe=
nger's seat.</p><p class=3D"">   The speed limit along that stretch of the =
parkway is 65 m.p.h.</p><p class=3D"">   The SUV, driven by a state trooper=
, was in the left lane with its emergency lights flashing when a pickup tri=
ed to get out of its way. Instead, it set off a chain reaction that resulte=
d in the crash.</p><p class=3D"">   Corzine broke his left thigh bone, 11 r=
ibs, collarbone and chest bone. He also fractured a vertebra in his lower b=
ack.</p><p class=3D"">   He remained in critical but stable condition Tuesd=
ay and doctors were assessing when he might be ready to breathe without a v=
entilator.</p><p class=3D"">   Doctors have said he doesn't have brain dama=
ge or paralysis, and is doing well for someone  with so many injuries.</p><=
p class=3D"">   The driver, Trooper Robert Rasinski, could be charged if in=
vestigators determine the crash was preventable, said Col. Rick Fuentes, su=
perintendent of state police.</p><p class=3D"">   Rasinski and an aide to t=
he governor were not seriously hurt.</p><p class=3D"">   There is no timeta=

ident Richard Codey is acting governor.</p><p class=3D"">   Once Corzine is=
 breathing unassisted, he should be able to speak. That would make it possi=
ble for physical therapists to do more to help him regain use of his leg, a=
 process expected to take up to six months. Corzine, 60, a former investmen=

p><div class=3D""><p class=3D"">   Large-company stocks advanced again Tues=
day, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average to just 14 points short of it=
s all-time high close. But there were more losers than winners among Nasdaq=
 and New York Stock Exchange stocks.</p><p class=3D"">   Once again, a batc=
h of favorable economic news and quarterly financial reports by major compa=
nies boosted the Dow and the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index.</p><p=
 class=3D"">   The Dow rose 52.58 points, to 12,773.04. The S&amp;P 500 add=
ed 3.01, to 1471.48.</p><p class=3D"">   Nasdaq stocks eased 1.38, to 2516.=
95. Among the Nasdaq losers, TD Ameritrade dropped more than 9 percent afte=
r the company reported disappointing results and trimmed its forecast.</p><=
p class=3D"">   An upbeat quarterly report by semiconductor giant Intel aft=
er the close of Tuesday's trading could give Nasdaq stocks a lift early Wed=
nesday.</p><p class=3D"">   On the other hand, International Business Machi=
nes and Internet portal Yahoo slipped in after-hours trading, reflecting di=
sappointment in their quarterly reports.</p><p class=3D"">   The Russell 20=
00 index of small-company stocks closed down 2.48, at 828.96, after hitting=
 an all-time high early in Tuesday's trading session.</p><p class=3D"">   C=
onsumer prices eased in March, compared with January and February data.</p>=
<p class=3D"">   Housing starts increased in March, thanks to a rebound in =
home construction in the Midwest. Housing stocks posted gains, led by KB Ho=
me and D.R. Horton.</p><p class=3D"">   Among the companies posting upbeat =
quarterly results were Coca- Cola and Johnson &amp; Johnson. The two blue-c=
hip companies were the biggest contributors to the Dow's gain.</p><p class=
=3D"">   New York Stock Exchange trading volume reached 1.57 billion shares=
. Losers held a slight edge over winners among NYSE-listed stocks.</p><p cl=
ass=3D"">   Nasdaq trading volume totaled 1.91 billion shares, as losers to=
pped winners by nearly a 3-2 ratio.</p><p class=3D"">   Treasury securities=
 ignored the housing news and advanced on the benign inflation report and w=
eak data on industrial production.</p><p class=3D"">   Oil and gasoline pri=
ces declined in New York futures trading.</p><p class=3D"">   The dollar we=
akened to more than $2 against the British pound, after an unexpected incre=
ase in British inflation prompted traders to assume that the Bank of Englan=
d will raise interest rates.</p>              <div class=3D""><div class=3D=

  </text></p><div class=3D""><p class=3D"">   The U.S. Supreme Court on Tue=
sday limited the power of states to oversee financial institutions, ruling =
that Michigan can't regulate the mortgage-lending subsidiaries of Wachovia =
Corp. and other federally chartered banks.</p><p class=3D"">   The justices=
, in a 5-3 vote, said banks regulated by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller=
 of the Currency have a broad shield from additional state scrutiny. The de=
cision comes amid calls for tighter regulation of the mortgage business bec=
ause of the subprime lending crisis.</p><p class=3D"">   The ruling spares =
so-called national banks, including Wachovia, National City Corp. and Wells=
 Fargo &amp; Co., from what they said would be a patchwork of rules around =
the country. Michigan laws require mortgage lenders to register with the st=
ate, pay annual fees, submit financial statements and keep records for exam=
ination purposes. At least six states, including California and Florida, ha=
ve similar regulations.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;Federal control shields n=
ational banking from unduly burdensome and duplicative state regulation,&qu=
ot; Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the majority.</p><p class=3D"">  =
 The case centered on the U.S. National Bank Act, which pre-empts states fr=
om regulating the activities of national banks. The main question was wheth=
er that principle applies when banks take advantage of the other legal prot=
ections they get by setting up subsidiaries. An OCC regulation, backed by t=
he court, says subsidiaries are shielded from state oversight just as their=
 parent companies are.</p><p class=3D"">   Justices Anthony Kennedy, David =
Souter, Stephen Breyer and Samuel Alito joined Ginsburg's opinion. Chief Ju=
stice John Roberts and Justices John Paul Stevens and Antonin Scalia dissen=
ted. Justice Clarence Thomas didn't take part in the case.</p><p class=3D""=
>   &quot;The federal interest in protecting depositors in national banks f=
rom their subsidiaries' liabilities surely does not justify a grant of immu=
nity from laws that apply to competitors,&quot; Stevens wrote. He said the =
OCC rule could &quot;drive companies seeking refuge from state regulation i=
nto the arms of federal parents.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Banking industry=
 representatives applauded the ruling, as did the Bush administration.</p><=
p class=3D"">   &quot;Avoiding a patchwork of duplicative and conflicting f=
ederal and state regulation makes it easier for national banks to grant cre=
dit to customers across state lines,&quot; said Edward Yingling, president =
of the American Bankers Association.</p><p class=3D"">   Consumer advocates=
 had argued that states are better equipped to protect their consumers agai=
nst predatory lending and other potential abuses because they are more fami=
liar with and accountable to their constituencies.</p><p class=3D"">   The =
case began in 2003, when Wachovia Mortgage became an operating subsidiary o=
f Wachovia Bank. After the mortgage lender said it would comply only with f=
ederal regulations, state officials banned it from operating in Michigan, p=
rompting Wachovia to sue. A federal appeals court sided with Wachovia, and =
the Supreme Court upheld that ruling.</p><p class=3D""> Credit: Bloomberg N=

=3D"">   Consumer prices eased in March, housing starts unexpectedly rose a=
nd factory output hit its fastest pace of the year, suggesting the economy =
will grow at a moderate pace with contained inflation.</p><p class=3D"">   =
The Labor Department said Tuesday that the so-called core consumer price in=
dex, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, rose just 0.1 percent=
 last month. The Commerce Department reported that housing starts increased=
 0.8 percent, led by a 45 percent jump in the Midwest, and the Federal Rese=
rve said factory output jumped 0.7 percent, though overall industrial produ=
ction fell as warm weather reduced electricity demand.</p><p class=3D"">   =
The inflation figures mean Federal Reserve policymakers might keep interest=
 rates unchanged when they meet again next month.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot=
;This is a big relief for the Fed,&quot; said Nigel Gault, chief U.S. econo=
mist at Global Insight Inc. in Lexington, Mass. &quot;It's one good month, =
and the Fed is going to have to see more good numbers before it can relax, =
but it comes after a few months where inflation was rising.&quot;</p><p cla=
ss=3D"">   Including food and energy, consumer prices rose 0.6 percent in M=
arch. Core prices were up 2.5 percent in the 12 months ended in March, the =
smallest year-over-year gain in almost a year. Overall, prices were up 2.8 =
percent from the same time last year.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;It'll take =
some time to establish the reality that core inflation isn't accelerating,&=
quot; said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International=
 Inc. in New York. &quot;The Fed is not going to let down their guard yet. =
By the end of the year, we'll see numbers that give us confidence.&quot;</p=
><p class=3D"">   Tuesday's report showed energy prices jumped 5.9 percent,=
 the most since September 2005, led by an 11 percent surge in gasoline pric=
es. Food prices, which account for about a fifth of the  price index, incre=
ased 0.3 percent. Rising demand for grain-based biofuels such as ethanol, w=
hich is distilled mostly from corn in the U.S., helped drive up food prices=
, economists said.</p><p class=3D"">   Housing costs, which include some en=
ergy costs and account for one-third of the total index, rose 0.2 percent. =
The cost of hotel stays dropped 2.3 percent, the biggest decline since Sept=
ember 2005. Medical care edged up 0.1 percent, the smallest gain since Augu=
st 2005. Clothing prices fell 1 percent, the most since April 2001.</p><p c=
lass=3D"">   The Commerce Department said builders broke ground on new home=
s at an annual rate of 1.518 million last month. Starts fell in the three o=
ther regions besides the Midwest. Economists had expected starts to fall to=
 a 1.495 million pace in March.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;From here on, dem=
and should continue to move upwards, albeit gradually, and building activit=
y should follow,&quot; said Guy Verberne, head of international economics a=
t Fortis Bank Nederland NV in Amsterdam.</p><p class=3D"">   Building permi=
ts, a sign of future construction, also rose 0.8 percent. Permits for singl=
e-family homes increased 1.4 percent. Construction of single-family homes r=
ose 2 percent, but work on multifamily structures fell 4 percent.</p><p cla=
ss=3D"">   In the third report, the Fed said industrial production declined=
 0.2 percent in March. Mining output, which includes oil drilling, rose 0.1=
 percent, but utility production dropped 7 percent.</p><p class=3D"">   &qu=
ot;Almost all the weakness was in utilities,&quot; said Kevin Logan, senior=
 market economist at Dresdner Kleinwort in New York. For factories, &quot;w=
e're getting back to a higher level, which is positive certainly for the ma=
nufacturing sector. So, it's slightly encouraging in manufacturing.&quot;</=
p><p class=3D"">   Manufacturing production increased on higher orders for =
business equipment such as computers. Factories are picking up the pace of =
production after working off bloated inventories. That could boost business=
 investment and provide support for a Fed forecast of an economic rebound.<=

lace like April in Paris. If you can't make the transatlantic flight this s=
pring, consider April in Chicago, with a French twist. Turns out the city h=
as a plethora of Parisian-style stores to browse. And Mayor Daley's fondnes=
s for French-style wrought iron fences and street lamps, which dot the city=
scape, makes it even easier to picture yourself in the City of Light.</p><p=
 class=3D"">   &quot;The romance of Paris in springtime is something to dre=
am about,&quot; says Susan Jablonski, owner of The Left Bank (1155 W. Webst=
er Ave., 773-929-7422) a jewelry boutique in Chicago. &quot;I've been a Fra=
ncophile my entire life.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Inspired by one of the f=
amous attractions in Paris, The Left Bank has a serious Francophile motto: =
&quot;The Soul of Paris in Chicago.&quot; The shop sells jewelry, antiques =
and gifts, as well as bridal accessories.</p><p class=3D"">   Jablonski is =
one of many Chicago store owners who has imported French products and chann=
eled the famed city's style.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;I've always admired =
French women -- how chic they are. They have an effortless way about them,&=
quot; says Kelly Bry, owner of Ouest (1063 W. Madison St., 312-421-2799) in=
 the West Loop. The store's motto: &quot;Inspired by the timeless elegance =
of the French woman.&quot; Ouest, which means &quot;west&quot; in French, c=
arries French designers such as Sonia Rykiel and Barbara Bui.</p><p class=
=3D"">   If anyone would know where to find French style in the city, it wo=
uld be Marie Vavassori, trade attache at the French Trade Office in Chicago=
.&quot;Shopping in France is about finding the little boutique that will ha=
ve the item that no one else will have -- the unique thing that everyone ar=
ound you will envy you for,&quot; she says.</p><p class=3D"">   Espace (120=
5 N. Milwaukee Ave., 773-252-6994) in Wicker Park, is one of her favorites.=
 She also recommends Porte Rouge (1911 W. Division St., 773-269-2800) for F=
rench cooking supplies, Hejfina (1529 N. Milwaukee Ave., 773-772-0002) for =
new designers and G Boutique (2131 N. Damen Ave., 773-235-1234), which carr=
ies Aubade, a French lingerie brand.</p><p class=3D"">   Of course, Chicago=
 has its share of internationally known French- owned stores, mostly cluste=
red along or near Michigan Avenue. Such famous names include the Chanel bou=
tique (935 N. Michigan Ave., 312- 787-5500), Hermes of Paris (110 E. Oak St=
., 312-787-8175), Louis Vuitton (919 N. Michigan Ave., 312-944-2010), L'Occ=
itane en Provence (900 N. Michigan Ave., 312-202-0906), Lacoste (835 N. Mic=
higan Ave. at Water Tower Place, 312-951-1300) and Anne Fontaine boutique (=
909 N. Michigan Ave., 312-943-0401).</p><p class=3D"">   The Magnificent Mi=
le has beaucoup French flair, but so do other Chicago neighborhoods.</p><p =
class=3D"">   You can't visit Paris without experiencing a French flea mark=
et. P.O.S.H. (613 N. State St., 312-280-1602), in the historic Tree Studios=
, offers the next best thing. Here you can find new and vintage home access=
ories from Europe and pick up a few French &quot;souvenirs,&quot; such as c=
harming Paris guidebooks or antique kitchen canisters.</p><p class=3D"">   =
Fabrice (1714 N. Wells St., 312-280-0011), in Old Town, models itself after=
 a Paris boutique and offers the famed Fabrice jewelry collection, known fo=
r its mix of feminine and bold pieces. Fabrice also offers handbags, wraps =
and bath and body products.</p><p class=3D"">   Cotelac (1159 W. Webster Av=
e., 773-281-2330), a French-owned fashion house, established its first loca=
tion outside of Europe in Lincoln Park. Cotelac is known for its fabric tre=
atment (crinkled or pleated) and wash-and-wear style.</p><p class=3D"">   W=
hether you shop along the Magnificent Mile or in neighborhood boutiques, yo=
u will have one advantage over Parisians when it comes to splurging, Vavass=
ori says.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;In France, because things are more expe=
nsive and harder to return, you think twice,&quot; she says. &quot;Also, th=
ere are sales here all year long. In France, you get summer and winter sale=
s, that's all. So I'd say that one probably buys twice as much here than in=
 France!&quot;</p>              <div class=3D""><div class=3D""><strong xml=

dly Monday, as Wall Street hit the trifecta: an upbeat economic report on r=
etail sales in March, better-than- expected quarterly results from Citigrou=
p and a major going-private takeover announcement.</p><p class=3D"">   The =
Dow Jones industrial average rose 108.33 points, to 12,720.46, to surpass i=
ts level on Feb. 26, the day before the market sank in a global rout sparke=
d by a sell-off in the Shanghai stock market. All but four of the 30 Dow in=
dustrials posted gains,  led by Citigroup. The banking giant reported bette=
r-than-expected quarterly revenue. Shares rose $1.33, to $52.93.</p><p clas=
s=3D"">   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 added 15.62, to 1468.47, its highes=
t level in more than six years. The Dow Jones Wilshire 5000, the broadest m=
easure of the U.S. stock market, reached an all-time high. The Nasdaq compo=
site index gained 26.39, to 2518.33. The Russell 2000 index of small-compan=
y stocks rose 12.06, to 831.44.</p><p class=3D"">   The U.S. results follow=
ed healthy gains in Asian and European stock markets. The yen reached a rec=
ord low against the euro and lost ground against the dollar after a weekend=
 meeting of finance officials from major industrial countries issued no sta=
tement regarding the trade consequences of the weak yen. A cheap yen makes =
Japanese exports more competitive against products made in other countries.=
</p><p class=3D"">   Sallie Mae, the firm that packages and sells student l=
oans, soared $8.29, or nearly 18 percent, to $55.05, after several private-=
 equity firms and major banks agreed to acquire the company for $25 billion=
.</p><p class=3D"">   Treasury bond prices rose as well, reflecting another=
 weak report on the housing market. The market on Tuesday faces reports on =
consumer price inflation and housing starts, as well as another batch of qu=
arterly financial reports by major companies.</p><p class=3D"">   Oil price=
s were little changed in futures trading.</p><p class=3D"">   TREASURY AUCT=
IONS: Interest rates edged lower at the weekly auctions of 3- and 6-month T=
reasury bills. The discount rate on 3- month bills was 4.86 percent, down f=
rom 4.88 percent at last week's auction. The rate on 6-month bills was 4.86=
 percent, down from 4.89 percent last week.</p><p class=3D"">   The coupon-=
equivalent investment rates at Monday's auction were 5.01 percent for 3-mon=
th bills and 5.07 percent for 6-month bills.</p>              <div class=3D=

 Chief executives of the biggest Wall Street firms urged President George W=
. Bush to seek greater access to overseas markets for U.S. financial servic=
es, adding to pressure that manufacturers and farmers are applying on the W=
hite House.</p><p class=3D"">   The Financial Services Forum, a lobbying gr=
oup of banks, securities firms and insurance companies, warned Bush in a le=
tter Monday that &quot;the continued growth and vitality&quot; of their bus=
inesses hinges on the administration's ability to negotiate trade agreement=
s that lower barriers to investment.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;We respectfu=
lly urge the administration to make the expansion of market access for fina=
ncial services firms a first-tier priority in all trade negotiations -- bot=
h bilateral and multinational efforts - - especially the Doha round,&quot; =
the Washington-based group said in the letter.</p><p class=3D"">   The requ=
est is signed by the forum's 20 members, including Citigroup Inc. CEO Charl=
es Prince, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO Lloyd Blankfein, Lehman Brothers Ho=
ldings Inc. CEO Richard Fuld, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. CEO Stanley O'Neal an=
d Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack.</p><p class=3D"">   The Doha round of World=
 Trade Organization talks is named after the city in Qatar where the talks =
began in 2001. Negotiations resumed in January, after breaking down in July=
 because the U.S. resisted cutting farm subsidies more unless India, the Eu=
ropean Union and Japan agreed to steep cuts in their agriculture duties.</p=
><p class=3D"">   The forum's letter said that the U.S. financial services =
industry is eight times larger than American farm output and two-thirds as =
large as manufacturing.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;We understand that the ad=
ministration and Congress must take into account the interests and objectiv=
es of all sectors of the U.S. economy,&quot; the letter stated. &quot;We ar=
e concerned, however, that the financial services sector is not receiving t=
he attention it deserves based on its contribution to the national economy.=
&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   U.S. financial institutions &quot;continue to en=
counter significant obstacles abroad,&quot; such as foreign ownership limit=
s, licensing quotas and excessive regulation, the group said. The obstacles=
 can be &quot;effectively addressed&quot; at the WTO, the group said, decli=
ning to name China's strict controls on foreign capital.</p><p class=3D""> =
  The letter was sent to the White House less than a week after the U.S. fi=
led two WTO complaints against China aimed at stopping what the Bush admini=
stration claims is rampant piracy of copyrighted movies, music, software an=
d books.</p><p class=3D"">   WTO negotiators from Australia, Japan, the U.S=
., the European Union, India and Brazil said last week in New Delhi that ta=
lks to conclude the Doha round are in a &quot;new phase.&quot; They pledged=
 to meet again next month in an effort to conclude an accord this year.</p>=
<p class=3D"">   Finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrial count=
ries said at a meeting April 13 that concluding the Doha talks was &quot;im=
perative&quot; and they pledged more aid for poorer countries as an incenti=
ve to complete negotiations.</p><p class=3D"">   The World Bank predicts th=
at a successful conclusion of the Doha round would boost the world economy =
by $96 billion.</p><p class=3D""> Credit: Bloomberg News</p>            </d=

>   Outdoor military-style boot camp fitness programs are gaining muscle an=
d recruiting more. And in some cases, boot camp itself is being drafted by =
gym members who are demanding that their club install one of these rigorous=
 programs. Within the last eight years alone, dozens of independent outdoor=
 boot camps have launched in the Chicago area, not including the major fitn=
ess chains that have added like programs to their curriculums, such as Life=
style Fitness, East Bank Club, Equinox and Xsport Fitness.</p><p class=3D""=
>   So why are these programs becoming so popular? Just like diets, exercis=
e regimens change and promote new angles on a similar theme. In the early 1=
980s, aerobics classes with high-impact cardiovascular training were all th=
e rage. Then walking made a comeback. Then yoga. Now most fitness programs =
and independent trainers promote cardiovascular exercise paired with streng=
th training.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;Boot camp fitness programs have beco=
me so popular because they incorporate strength and cardio training into an=
 hour workout, saving you time by getting your heart rate up while working =
your muscles,&quot; said Andrea Metcalf, owner of MBC Fitness (mind-body- c=
onnection), 28 North Cass Ave., Westmont (630-493-3000), and a member of th=
e NBC 5 Fitness Team. Boot camps also offer a good deal. In many ways, it's=
 like having the attention of a personal trainer but at group rates.</p><p =
class=3D"">   &quot;I started my Bulldog Bootcamp because I really loved he=
lping people get in shape but, like them, found the health club setting inc=
reasingly boring,&quot; said Greg Major, owner of Bulldog Bootcamp (866-966=
-3966, <a href=3D"http://bulldogbootcamp.com" class=3D"">bulldogbootcamp.co=
m</a>). &quot;I started meeting my clients outside to workout, creating a g=
ym without walls, and there we tackled big fitness challenges that can rare=
ly be achieved in a gym setting.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Boot camp progra=
ms, for the most part, share a common outdoor hourly itinerary and a strict=
, yet encouraging fitness sergeant to push you through an often rigorous ro=
utine. First, there's a warm- up to make sure the major muscles get stretch=
ed, followed by cardio in the form of jogging, sprinting, relays or circuit=
 work. Strength training is thrown in with push-ups, sit-ups, lunges, crunc=
hes, squats and numerous variations.</p><p class=3D"">   Camp usually is Mo=
nday through Friday, and each program promises something different each day=
. Trainers may alternate heavy cardio and light strength training one day, =
followed by a session of heavy strength training and very little cardio. Wh=
en joining, you are asked to run through an assessment in which your progre=
ss will be compared with your four-week assessment test.</p><p class=3D""> =
  Results more than physical</p><p class=3D"">   Most boot campers report g=
ood results. In Metcalf's Naked Boot Camp, campers were weighed before and =
after an eight-week program and showed an average weight loss of 13 pounds =
and average body fat drop of 5 percent. But the positive results are more t=
han physical.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;We all cheer each other on, and in =
turn, we build relationships and a sense of camaraderie,&quot; said Renee D=
avis of Oak Park, who tried Chicago Boot Camp for Women (773-577-7538, <a h=
ref=3D"http://bootcampchicago.com" class=3D"">bootcampchicago.com</a>). &qu=
ot;When I started the camp, I couldn't jog a half block, and now I can jog =
a mile without the slightest problem. It's that sense of accomplishment, to=
o, that has given me an amazing amount of confidence in all areas of my lif=
e.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Davis said this sense of confidence has carrie=
d over in her work and family life, making every aspect of her life easier =
thanks to the energy and feelings of self-accomplishment she gains from wak=
ing up each weekday to attend boot camp.</p><p class=3D"">   A boot camp fo=
r everyone</p><p class=3D"">   While most boot camps share a similar exerci=
se model, each one is different. Some programs are tailored for brides, new=
 mothers, for men and women, women only, for marathon or sports training, w=
ith spiritual aspects or for varying fitness levels.</p><p class=3D"">   In=
 fact, Mike George of Mike George Fitness System (312-943- 6700, <a href=3D=
"http://mg-fitness.com" class=3D"">mg-fitness.com</a>) is taking the milita=
ry style of fitness to a different level; he even offers free admission for=
 up to 10 active military reservists. Refusing to call it a boot camp progr=
am, he terms the program &quot;Fit to Fight,&quot; and it helps everyone en=
rolled become perfectly fit to deal with anything from the daily grind to s=
udden monumental catastrophes to responding to accidents to defending yours=
elf in an attack.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;After 9/11, the face of our bat=
tlefield changed at home, with many citizens enrolling in the Army and with=
 most of us becoming aware and protective of our surroundings,&quot; George=
 said. &quot;But now, we've become complacent, and in reality, Americans ar=
e fat and out of shape. Very few of us are able to defend ourselves.&quot;<=
/p><p class=3D"">   George's program is a five-day-a-week class, 5:30 to 6:=
30 a.m. Tuesday through Saturday at North Avenue Beach. Like boot camps, ea=
ch day is different, but he adds CPR skills, weighted body bars for gun and=
 knife handling, 120-pound water bags to simulate lifesaving techniques as =
well as karate, judo, boxing and aikido fundamentals.</p><p class=3D"">   B=
efore joining any program, ask the fitness director if there are any physic=
al requirements, and when in doubt see your doctor for guidance regarding a=
ny rigorous physical activity. Programs range from $90 to $400 for a four-w=
eek session. If you already belong to a gym, ask about special boot camp se=
ssions that may already be included in your membership.</p><p class=3D"">  =

g-term securities slowed in February from the previous month, as investors =
purchased fewer American stocks and agency bonds.</p><p class=3D"">   Total=
 purchases of equities, notes and bonds rose a net $58.1 billion, down from=
 $98.8 billion in January, the Treasury Department said Monday. Including s=
hort-term securities such as Treasury bills and non-market trades such as s=
tock swaps, foreigners bought a net $94.5 billion, up from $79.6 billion th=
e month before.</p><p class=3D"">   The U.S. stock market slid on Feb. 27, =
in part because of rising concerns about a slowing economy and defaults in =
the subprime mortgage market. While benchmark stock indexes have since reco=
vered, they are still below February's highs.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;The=
 subprime story still has some legs,&quot; said Mike Englund, chief economi=
st at Action Economics LLC in Boulder, Colo. &quot;The people who were conc=
erned in February still think the market could get blindsided at any time.&=

urities in February, compared with a net $104.5 billion in January. Officia=
l purchases, mostly by central banks, rose by a net $12.6 billion, up from =
$12.3 billion the previous month.</p><p class=3D"">   International purchas=
es of U.S. stocks fell to a net $13.5 billion from $22.8 billion in January=
. Delinquencies on subprime loans, made typically to those with poor credit=
 history, rose to 13.3 percent in the fourth quarter.</p><p class=3D"">   &=
quot;There was a worry the subprime malaise would spread,&quot; said Michae=

 were leery of investing in the U.S.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Purchases of=
 agency debt also slowed, dropping to a net $2 billion in February from a n=
et $35.8 billion the previous month. The securities are issued by agencies =
including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p><p class=3D"">   Foreigners accumu=

 Albert H. MacLeod, a retired vice president of the Harris Bank and long-ti=
me resident of Highland Park, died Sunday. He was 90. Mr. MacLeod, a Chicag=
o native, served the city well, as chairman of the Board of Trustees of the=
 YWCA of Chicago during the fundraising and building of the Harriet Harris =
YWCA on Chicago's South Side. Once, when calling on a potential donor, he w=
as told that the company had already given to the YMCA. &quot;Then it's tim=
e for the girls,&quot; he said with his characteristic directness, and left=
 with a similar donation for the girls. Mr. MacLeod was also a member of th=
e board of directors of the Isham YMCA. He moved to Highland Park from Winn=
etka in the early 1970s and eventually served two terms on the Highland Par=
k City Council from 1983 to 1991. In his later years, he became a generous =
supporter of the Highland Park Community Foundation. In March, 2006, he rec=
eived the organization's first Distinguished Citizen Award for his strong s=
upport in establishing the foundation, which uses interest from an endowmen=
t for grants to support community organizations. He also supported arts and=
 cultural organizations throughout the Chicago land area. Born on Chicago's=
 south side on Jan. 24, 1917, he was a great randson of Norman Wait Harris,=
 the founder of the Harris Bank. Mr. MacLeod spent his youth in southern Ca=
lifornia and was the first of three generations to graduate from Pomona Col=
lege. He also served as a trustee of the college. During World War II, Mr. =
MacLeod served in the U.S. Navy Supply Corps. Following the war, he was dis=
charged as a Lieutenant Commander. Mr. MacLeod is survived by his wife Mart=
ha; sons Craig and Andrew; daughters Jessi Ruth MacLeod and Martha Flanders=
; step- children Price Patton, Ann Patton and Sarah Duncan; 18 grandchildre=
n and one great-grandchild. A memorial service will be held at 3 p.m. Satur=
day at Trinity Episcopal Church, 425 Laurel Ave., Highland Park. In lieu of=
 flowers, the family ask that donations be made in Mr. MacLeod's memory to =
the Highland Park Community Foundation.</p>            </div><div class=3D"=

lass=3D""><p class=3D"">   When Chicago native Norman Bobins announced in J=
anuary that he was retiring as head of ABN Amro's North American operations=
, area banking observers were anxious to see whether the Amsterdam-based fi=
nancial institution would name a Dutch replacement.</p><p class=3D"">   Doi=
ng so, they figured, would signal that ABN wanted to keep a closer eye on i=
ts LaSalle unit, Chicago's second-biggest bank, after JPMorgan Chase &amp; =
Co., with deposit market share of 14.1 percent.</p><p class=3D"">   On Mond=
ay, ABN picked Chicagoan Robert Moore, chief financial officer of LaSalle a=
nd ABN Amro North America, to become head of its North American unit effect=
ive May 1.</p><p class=3D"">   But the promotion of the Lake Bluff resident=
 and graduate of Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management cou=
ld be a hollow victory for Chicago civic boosters because ABN faces an unce=
rtain future.</p><p class=3D"">   Last month, ABN entered exclusive takeove=
r talks with British bank Barclays PLC, and Friday it acknowledged that a c=
onsortium of three other banks, including Charter One parent Royal Bank of =
Scotland PLC, also has invited it into &quot;exploratory talks&quot; about =
a deal.</p><p class=3D"">   Depending on who buys ABN, its Chicago-area ope=
rations could undergo a restructuring. For example, because of its area pre=
sence with Charter One, RBS could find itself with duplicate positions that=
 would have to be cut if it winds up with the winning bid. A Barclays deal,=
 on the other hand, could mean less upheaval for LaSalle workers because Ba=
rclays isn't a major U.S. retail banking force.</p><p class=3D"">   RBS, wh=
ose Charter One has Chicago-area deposit market share of 2.8 percent, said =
last week that it might offer to buy ABN with Banco Santander Central Hispa=
no SA and Fortis.</p><p class=3D"">   Moore, 45, also will assume the title=
 of senior executive vice president for ABN Amro globally. He rejoined ABN =
as CFO for North American operations, including LaSalle, in September 2006,=
 after working for the Dutch bank in North America from 1996 to 2001. Befor=
e rejoining the company, he spent six years at Diageo PLC in London.</p><p =
class=3D"">   &quot;The board decided to make this appointment at this time=
 because our strategy for North America remains clear: We must build upon o=
ur legacy of success while striving for continuous performance improvement,=
&quot; Joost Kuiper, ABN Amro board member responsible for North America, s=
aid in a statement.</p><p class=3D"">   In January, Bobins said he would re=
tire at year's end. At that time, it was announced that his role would be d=
ivided into two jobs. Moore assumes the CEO post responsible for all ABN ac=
tivities in North America, including holding company LaSalle Bank Corp. Lar=
ry Richman earlier was named CEO of LaSalle Bank and will report to Moore.<=
/p><p class=3D"">   As previously announced, Bobins will assume the positio=
n of LaSalle Bank Corp. chairman May 1.</p><p class=3D"">   Separately, ABN=
 said Monday that first-quarter net income rose to 71 cents a share from 53=
 cents a share  a year earlier, helped by the sale of a mortgage business a=
nd higher income in  Europe.</p><p class=3D"">   --------</p><p class=3D"">=

                     </text></p><div class=3D""><p class=3D"">   How many p=
ast presidents of the World Bank have been household names? How many have b=
ecome the subject of front-page controversies? None that come to mind. That=
's not because they were all stellar performers, or because the bank has do=
ne an exceptional job of curing poverty.</p><p class=3D"">   Then there is =
Paul Wolfowitz. The frenzy over his performance suggests it's far more dang=
erous to be bold and innovative in carrying out the World Bank's mission th=
an to stick to the way things have always been done.</p><p class=3D"">   Wo=
lfowitz is currently being assailed because of his handling of a conflict o=
f interest involving a longtime girlfriend, Shaha Raza, who worked at the i=
nstitution.</p><p class=3D"">   It's a classic manufactured scandal, in whi=
ch minor suspicions are pumped out of proportion, giving critics the chance=
 to say the person in question must leave because he can no longer function=
 effectively. If Wolfowitz is driven out over charges such as these, it wil=
l be a message to able, strong-minded people that they should shun public s=
ervice at all costs.</p><p class=3D"">   The accusation against Wolfowitz i=
s that he arranged a cushy deal for Raza, including a promotion and a big p=
ay raise in her new job at the State Department.</p><p class=3D"">   But it=
's clear he tried to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. He offered t=
o recuse himself from matters involving her, but the ethics committee said =
that wouldn't suffice. It was agreed she would leave for the State Departme=
nt, and the committee recommended compensation for the damage to her career=
.</p><p class=3D"">   It then ordered Wolfowitz to see that its decision wa=
s implemented, which left him in the position of having to dictate the term=
s of her departure, including the salary increase. An outside law firm hire=
d to conduct an independent review of the agreement concluded it was &quot;=
a reasonable resolution&quot; that would avoid the risk of &quot;protracted=
 legal proceedings.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Wolfowitz apologized last wee=
k for his role in the episode. But no matter how carefully he conducted him=
self, it's clear he had plenty of enemies inside and outside the bank eager=
 to seize any excuse to undermine him.</p><p class=3D"">   As one of the ar=
chitects of the Iraq war, his appointment didn't go over well in Europe and=
 other places where the war is highly unpopular. And his decision to make a=
 priority of fighting the pervasive corruption at the World Bank provoked a=
ntagonism among veteran staffers who were accustomed to a certain amount of=
 graft among recipient governments.</p><p class=3D"">   An example: After R=
epublic of Congo President Denis Sassou- Nguesso racked up hundreds of thou=
sands of dollars in hotel bills on a visit to New York, Wolfowitz decided t=
o oppose debt relief for his government.</p><p class=3D"">   That stand won=
 plaudits from reformers in Congo, but not from some European governments, =
including the French. They argued, as National Public Radio put it, that &q=
uot;the World Bank needed to remain engaged in poor countries such as Congo=
, regardless of how corrupt their governments may be.&quot;</p><p class=3D"=
">   Should the World Bank treat corruption as a debilitating virus that re=
tards development in poor countries? That's an excellent topic for analysis=
 and debate, which Wolfowitz tried to kick-start.</p><p class=3D"">   Too b=
ad his critics would rather talk about matters that have far less to do wit=
h the fate of the world's poor.</p>            </div><div class=3D""><br cl=

v class=3D""><p class=3D"">   A group of investors on Monday announced plan=
s to buy Sallie Mae, taking the nation's largest student lender private in =
a $25 billion deal that comes as some regulators call for tougher standards=
 and lower federal subsidies for the $85 billion college loan industry.</p>=
<p class=3D"">   Private-equity firm J.C. Flowers &amp; Co. and three other=
 investors will pay $60 a share for Reston, Va.-based SLM Corp., commonly r=
eferred to as Sallie Mae. The sale price represents a nearly 50 percent pre=
mium for Sallie Mae's previously sagging stock before takeover rumors emerg=
ed late last week.</p><p class=3D"">   Shares of Sallie Mae surged $8.29, o=
r 17.7 percent, to $55.05, Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p cla=
ss=3D"">   J.C. Flowers and private-equity firm Friedman Fleischer &amp; Lo=
we will invest $4.4 billion and own 50.2 percent of the company. Bank of Am=
erica Corp. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. each will invest $2.2 billion and =
each will own 24.9 percent. The buyers also will provide Sallie Mae with $2=
00 billion in backup financing.</p><p class=3D"">   John Oros, a managing d=
irector at J.C. Flowers, said the firm was drawn by Sallie Mae's stock pric=
e, which had fallen to about $40 a share before takeover talks began. The i=
nvestors also weren't deterred by the brewing troubles for lenders and the =
prospect of a clampdown on the industry by lawmakers.</p><p class=3D"">   &=
quot;We think Sallie Mae is a great company and a great business, and appro=
priate regulation will sort itself out in a way that will make this an attr=
active transaction for us,&quot; Oros said.</p><p class=3D"">   Sallie Mae =
is by far the largest school lender, originating $23.4 billion in student l=
oans last year, many of them federally subsidized, such as widely used Staf=
ford loans.</p><p class=3D"">   But it has also been subject to greater att=
ention from lawmakers and regulators currently probing ties between lenders=
 and college officials who guide students toward specific lenders for their=
 loans.</p><p class=3D"">   Company spokesman Tom Joyce said that even thou=
gh the company will be private, it will still be subject to federal and sta=
te lending laws. Student borrowers and institutions will see no change in t=
he way loans are handled or processed, he said.</p><p class=3D""> Credit: A=

biggest bank, said Monday that first- quarter earnings dropped 11 percent b=
ecause of expenses to slash 17,000 jobs, but it still beat estimates and it=
 reported the fastest growth in revenue in almost three years.</p><p class=
=3D"">   The New York-based bank posted net income of $5.01 billion, or $1.=
01 a share, down from $5.64 billion, or $1.12 a share. It was the third str=
aight quarter that net income declined. Excluding a $871 million charge, Ci=
tigroup would have earned $1.18 a share, beating estimates by 9 cents a sha=
re.</p><p class=3D"">   Revenue rose 15 percent, to $25.5 billion, while ex=
penses increased to $14 billion from $12.7 billion. It was the first time r=
evenue grew faster than operating costs since the third quarter of 2005, le=
d by a 36 percent surge in profit from investment banking and trading.</p><=
p class=3D"">   &quot;Revenues up 15 percent, expenses up only about 10 per=
cent, if you adjust them for the restructuring charge,&quot; said Chris Hag=
edorn, a portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cincinnati. &=
quot;That's a piece of news that investors will key on.&quot;</p><p class=

 Grainger Inc., in what it called &quot;a strong start to the year,&quot; r=
eported a stronger-than-expected 18 percent increase in first-quarter earni=
ngs.</p><p class=3D"">   The Lake Forest-based distributor of facilities-ma=
intenance products said net income was $101.8 million, or $1.17 a diluted s=
hare, up from the year-ago period's $86.2 million, or 93 cents a share. Sal=
es rose 9 percent, to $1.55 billion. Analysts had expected Grainger's per-s=
hare earnings to be $1.09.</p><p class=3D"">   Revenue benefited from stron=
g sales of products related to the unseasonably cold weather in March. Howe=
ver, it noted a sales drag &quot;as the company continues to unwind low mar=
gin contracts for automotive and integrated-supply customers.&quot;</p><p c=
lass=3D"">   The latest quarter benefited from a $1.3 million gain from the=
 sale of certain assets. Per-share results reflect a decline in Grainger sh=
ares outstanding to 84 million from 89.6 million a year ago.</p><p class=3D=

ped to $2.3 billion, or $1.20 a share, from $1.73 billion, or $1.09 a share=
, a year ago. Excluding merger and restructuring charges, the nation's four=
th- largest bank would have earned $1.20 a share. On that basis, Wall Stree=

=3D"">   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who steadfastly has resisted f=
ull-fledged peace talks with the Palestinians, held a wide-ranging discussi=
on with their leader Sunday on relations between Israel and a future Palest=
inian state.</p><p class=3D"">   Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud A=
bbas were accompanied by aides for the first half of the two-hour meeting a=
nd then talked one on one. They issued no statements afterward, leaving the=
 aides to give somewhat differing accounts.</p><p class=3D"">   Saeb Erekat=
, an aide to Abbas, called the meeting a breakthrough, the first time since=
 the collapse of peace talks in 2001 that the two sides had discussed a sce=
nario for Palestinian independence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p><p c=
lass=3D"">   &quot;We started today to talk about a political horizon&quot;=
 beyond the conflict, Erekat said. &quot;It was a good beginning.&quot;</p>=
<p class=3D"">   However, Israeli officials said Olmert avoided &quot;final=
 status&quot; issues at the heart of the conflict, including the borders of=
 a future Palestinian state, a possible division of Jerusalem and the fate =
of Palestinian refugees wanting to return to homes in Israel.</p><p class=
=3D"">   The luncheon meeting at Olmert's official residence was arranged u=
nder prodding by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is strugglin=
g to revive peace efforts. The two men, who had held three previous encount=
ers since December, agreed recently at Rice's insistence to meet every two =
weeks.</p><p class=3D"">   Olmert has refused to address final status issue=
s unless the Palestinian Authority government, a coalition of Abbas' Fatah =
movement and the Hamas movement that refuses to make peace with Israel, exp=
licitly recognizes the Jewish state and forswears violence.</p><p class=3D"=
">   Meanwhile, the Israelis say, any talks about a peace settlement are hy=
pothetical.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;They did not speak about final status=
 issues,&quot; David Baker, an Olmert spokesman, said after Sunday's meetin=
g. &quot;They did speak about a political horizon, which included economic =
cooperation with a future Palestinian state and expanding the dialogue abou=
t economic ventures with Palestinians and how a future Palestinian economy =
would be comprised in such a state.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   But Erekat, a=
t a news conference in the West Bank city of Ramallah, said the two leaders=
 touched indirectly on key political issues while discussing a recently rev=
ived Saudi peace initiative. He predicted a more substantive discussion in =
the coming weeks.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;Not all issues can be resolved =
in one, two or three meetings,&quot; Erekat said. &quot;But I can say that =
we have started to talk.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   An aide said Olmert insi=
sted that Abbas &quot;put all his weight, all his influence&quot; to win th=
e release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who was captured by Palestinian =
militants, including some from Hamas, nearly 10 months ago along the Gaza b=
order.</p><p class=3D"">   The leaders discussed but reported no response t=
o the captors' demands, passed recently to Israel through Egyptian mediator=
s and Abbas' government, to free 1,400 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.<=
/p><p class=3D"">   In Gaza, meanwhile, a previously unknown Palestinian gr=
oup said Sunday it had killed a British journalist kidnapped March 12 in Ga=
za City, but the claim could not be confirmed.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;Th=
e brigades of Tawheed and Jihad&quot; said it killed correspondent Alan Joh=
nston, 44, of the British Broadcasting Corp. to call attention to the impri=
sonment of thousands of Palestinians in Israel. The Palestinian government =
and the BBC said there was no evidence to back up the claim.</p><p class=3D=

p><div class=3D""><p class=3D"">   Sen. Barack Obama raised more money from=
 donors for his presidential primary campaign than any other candidate duri=
ng the first three months of the year, but Democratic front-runner Sen. Hil=
lary Rodham Clinton maintained a financial advantage by transferring money =
left from her Senate re-election campaign last year.</p><p class=3D"">   Ob=
ama raised $24.8 million for the primary, compared with Clinton's $19.1 mil=
lion.</p><p class=3D"">   Still, Clinton has the bigger war chest. The New =
York senator reported $24.1 million available for her primary campaign, bol=
stered by $10 million from her Senate re-election campaign. She also raised=
 an additional $6.9 million that only can be used in a general election cam=
paign.</p><p class=3D"">   Obama (D-Ill.) reported $18.2 million left after=
 expenses to spend on the primary. He reported an additional $1 million ava=
ilable for the later campaign.</p><p class=3D"">   Though both Clinton and =
Obama have held a series of big-dollar fundraisers, Clinton has relied more=
 on wealthy donors who contributed the maximum legal contribution of $2,300=
 each to both the primary and general election campaigns.</p><p class=3D"">=
   Funds for the general election provide no strategic advantage during the=
 primary contest since they must be kept separate and cannot be spent until=
 after a candidate receives their party's nomination.</p><p class=3D"">   C=
linton and Obama spent their campaign funds at a similar rate, with both re=
porting a little under $7 million in combined expenses and accumulated debt=
s. And they were considerably more frugal than the two leading Republican s=
penders: Mitt Romney, who spent $11.6 million and showed no unpaid bills ot=
her than a loan to the campaign from his personal funds, and Sen. John McCa=
in (R-Ariz.), who showed $10.2 million in expenses and accumulated debts.</=
p><p class=3D"">   Clinton and Obama each dominated fundraising on their ho=
me turf.</p><p class=3D"">   Clinton raised more than twice as much than Ob=
ama from New York City addresses, while Obama bested Clinton's Chicago fund=
raising, collecting nearly 15 times as much as she did in the Second City. =
Obama raised $2.1 million from people listing Chicago addresses, while Clin=
ton pulled in $4.5 million from the Big Apple.</p><p class=3D"">   Although=
 Obama has focused much of his efforts on building a network of small donor=
s, he raised the legal limit from about 4,800 of his 104,000 contributors f=
or the primary campaign, while Clinton hit that level with about 5,100 of h=
er 60,000 donors. For each campaign, that relatively wealthy sliver of thei=
r donor base contributed a big share of their money -- more than $11 millio=
n to each campaign for spending on the primary.</p><p class=3D"">   Democra=
t John Edwards reported raising $13 million for the primary, with $9.8 mill=
ion in cash available to campaign for the party nomination and a little mor=
e than $900,000 for the general election.</p><p class=3D"">   Edwards saw a=
 surge in donor support after the announcement that his wife's breast cance=
r had returned. He raised about $5.4 million following the late-March revel=
ation, more than a third of his total for the quarter.</p><p class=3D"">   =
While the first votes will not be cast until the Iowa caucuses next January=
, the candidates already are engaged in a struggle to build financial resou=
rces for a primary season that most political professionals expect will be =
extraordinarily costly. Major candidates are expected to spend $100 million=
 or more.</p><p class=3D"">   The money chase has accelerated this election=
 because early primaries are bunched and a slew of large states have moved =
their primaries to early in the year, making costly television advertising =
especially important. The major candidates also have indicated they will no=
t accept public funds, meaning they do not have to abide by spending limits=
 that constrained candidates in past elections.</p><p class=3D"">   Overall=
, the early fundraising showed the Democratic donor base rallying to their =
candidates more than did Republican contributors. While Republican candidat=
es historically have out-raised Democrats, the GOP  candidates collectively=
 raised about two-thirds as much as their Democratic counterparts.</p><p cl=
ass=3D"">   Romney reported $11.9 million cash on hand and Former New York =
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani showed $10.8 million available for the primaries, ac=
cording to disclosures filed earlier.</p><p class=3D"">   Democratic Gov. B=
ill Richardson of New Mexico, who raised $6.2 million, finished the quarter=
 with $5 million cash on hand, nearly as rich as the $5.2 million bank bala=
nce shown by McCain, who was considered the GOP front-runner at the start o=
f the year.</p><p class=3D"">   And Richardson had fewer debts, with less t=
han $20,000 in IOUs compared with McCain's $1.8 million in red ink.</p><p c=
lass=3D"">   The fundraising figures were contained in campaign finance dis=
closures for the first quarter that each candidate was required to file by =
Sunday.</p><p class=3D"">   ----------</p><p class=3D"">   <a href=3D"mailt=

p><div class=3D""><p class=3D"">CORRECTION: This story contains corrected m=
aterial, published April 19, 2007.</p><p class=3D"">   A man recently relea=
sed from prison is accused of setting a fast- moving fire early Sunday that=
 engulfed his cousin's home, killing  five of her children, authorities and=
 a family member said.</p><p class=3D"">   A family member said Zachary Mee=
ks, 27, had quarreled with the cousin, Jeanette Clark, half an hour earlier=
 in a casino bar over his role in a family feud. Their brief fight at the C=
asino Starlite Terrace ended after she slapped him, said Michelle Pleasant =
(the name as published has been corrected here and in subsequent references=
 in this text), who said she is Clark's friend (the relationship of Michell=
e Pleasant to the children's mother has been corrected in this text).</p><p=
 class=3D"">   Meeks left calmly, she said.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;I can=
't believe it escalated to this,&quot; Pleasant said. &quot;Maybe it would =
be easier to deal with if it was just one, but it was all of them and they =
were innocent.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Adams County Coroner Gary Hamilton=
 identified the victims as Kendall Edwards, 10; Althea Clark, 9; Cameron Cl=
ark, 7 and Khalil Clark, 5.; and Kejuan Clark, 5 months (this sentence as p=
ublished has been corrected in this text). Four were found on the second fl=
oor of the two-story brick house and one was on the first floor.</p><p clas=
s=3D"">   Jeanette Clark, their mother,  had moved the family to this town =
on the banks of the Mississippi River from Chicago's South Side two years a=
go in search of small-town simplicity, Pleasant said.</p><p class=3D"">   &=
quot;We were trying to leave the crazy life behind,&quot; Pleasant said.</p=
><p class=3D"">   Meeks, accused of starting the fire about 3 a.m., was arr=
ested about 6 a.m. when police were called to a fight at his home two block=
s away, authorities said. Meeks' mother, Pamela Meeks- Washington, said sev=
eral family members went to her son's home to confront him about the fire.<=
/p><p class=3D"">   He was pistol whipped, but not seriously injured, she s=
aid.</p><p class=3D"">   He was being held Sunday on five counts of first-d=
egree murder, arson and aggravated arson, police said. Formal charges will =
be filed Monday, authorities said.</p><p class=3D"">   Meeks-Washington, 46=
, of Joliet, said her son is a father of three. He  has a history of drug a=
nd alcohol abuse and long been treated for depression, she said. He baby-sa=
t for the dead children, she said.</p><p class=3D"">   He was born on the  =
South Side, but has lived most of his life in Quincy, she said.</p><p class=
=3D"">   &quot;He loved those kids,&quot; Meeks-Washington said. &quot;He'd=
 play with them, and he'd watch them. He wouldn't hurt them.&quot;</p><p cl=
ass=3D"">   Meeks was paroled by the Illinois Department of Corrections in =
December on a drug charge. He also was convicted in 2002 of aggravated batt=
ery, according to the Department of Corrections.</p><p class=3D"">   Pleasa=
nt said she was at the casino with the children's parents, Jeanette and Kei=
th Clark, about 2:30 a.m. Sunday when Meeks approached.</p><p class=3D"">  =
 Police confirmed that Meeks had been in a quarrel with someone injured in =
the fire, but would not elaborate. They also would not say how the fire was=
 set, but said physical evidence ties Meeks to the crime.</p><p class=3D"">=
   Authorities declined to release preliminary causes of death and said aut=
opsies are planned.</p><p class=3D"">   Pleasant said she came home from th=
e bar to see the house engulfed and her sister and brother-in-law screaming=
 and crying. Police said a woman had to be hospitalized after she broke fre=
e from firefighters and tried to crawl through a window to get to the child=
ren.</p><p class=3D"">   Family members said the woman was Jeanette Clark, =
who was discharged later in the day. Police said Keith Clark remained hospi=
talized in Springfield for burns.</p><p class=3D"">   Sue Johnson, who live=
s across the street from the home, said she heard the sound of a car door s=
lamming and tires squealing about the time of the fire, but went back to sl=
eep. She awoke to firetrucks and flashing lights in front of her home.</p><=
p class=3D"">   &quot;I wish I would have gotten up and looked out,&quot; s=
he said. &quot;Maybe I could have saw the fire when it started and they cou=
ld have got out.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Police said it is unclear if the=
 children's parents were home when the fire began and that the case has bee=
n reported to the Department of Children and Family Services.</p><p class=
=3D"">   Neighbors said the family attended church every Sunday and that th=
e kids were a regular fixture in the neighborhood, often playing in their f=
ront yard.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;They were the sweetest kids,&quot; sai=
d Arlene Petty, a neighbor. &quot;It's hard to think that one day you are w=
atching them play ball and watching them ride their bikes and the next you =
are watching their bodies being carried out.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   The =
Clarks have two other children who were not home Saturday night, Pleasant s=
aid.</p><p class=3D"">   By Sunday evening, a 6-foot cross had been erected=
 in front of the house alongside a statue of an angel and vases of fresh fl=
owers.</p><p class=3D"">   -----------</p><p class=3D"">   <a href=3D"mailt=

-poke customers to pay their bills on time, or reasonably on time, can be a=
 vexing problem for a small-business owner. Besides creating cash-flow issu=
es, late payments can be a time and energy waster if it takes phone calls a=
nd e-mails to get a customer to finally send a check.</p><p class=3D"">   B=
usiness owners who have struggled with the problem have a variety of ways t=
o deal with the problem, including educating customers about payment terms,=
 insisting on a substantial deposit before work begins or hiring someone to=
 keep after the foot- draggers.</p><p class=3D"">   Some business owners ha=
ve found that unless they are clear at the beginning about payment terms, c=
ustomers may take their time. It is human nature to put things off, and all=
 of us have to prioritize what we use money for. But if a company states fr=
om the get-go, &quot;Here is how we need to be paid,&quot; a customer is mo=
re likely to get the message.</p><p class=3D"">   Dana Korey lost time and =
productivity at her professional organizing business trying to collect on i=
nvoices weeks or months after they were sent out. Korey, founder of Away Wi=
th Clutter Inc. in Del Mar, Calif., said &quot;being really clear about the=
 deposit and being exceptionally clear about the day the balance would be d=
ue&quot; turned the situation around.</p><p class=3D"">   Korey raised the =
deposit to 60 percent from 50 percent, put payment terms in bold-face type =
in contracts and had customers sign or initial every provision that dealt w=
ith payment. Employees also state the payment terms aloud during the contra=
ct-signing process.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;It actually has worked phenom=
enally,&quot; she said of the changes.</p><p class=3D"">   Gini Dietrich sa=
id her Chicago-based public relations firm, Arment Dietrich, would have had=
 to go out of business because of slow payments if she hadn't implemented a=
 payment policy, because its cash flow was so poor</p><p class=3D"">   &quo=
t;Literally, I was playing bank for my clients,&quot; she said.</p><p class=
=3D"">   Dietrich added, &quot;I wasn't very good at asking for the money,&=
quot; something that many business owners can identify with.</p><p class=3D=
"">   Her solution has been to require two months' retainer fees up front, =
refuse to give discounts for early payments (many companies will shrug off =
the discount and pay later, she said) and insist on out-of-pocket expenses =
to be paid up front.</p><p class=3D"">   And, if an invoice is more than 45=
 days past due, work on the project stops immediately.</p><p class=3D"">   =
The result: Dietrich stayed in business and has a healthy cash flow.</p><p =
class=3D"">   Carol Borow and Dan Venet say their slow-payment problems hav=
e been made easier because they have an employee whose duties including cal=
ling customers who haven't paid. Borow and Venet, who own CHB Industries In=
c., a New York-based provider of window film, don't spend their time chasin=
g late payments unless the situation really demands their intervention.</p>=
<p class=3D"">   &quot;It's often very helpful to make sure that payment te=
rms are negotiated up front, and if you can get a deposit up front, that's =
better,&quot; Borow said.</p><p class=3D"">   Small-business owners who wan=
t to develop a payment policy have plenty of resources, starting with other=
 company owners, especially if they are in the same industry, and their acc=
ountants. Talking to veterans of the bill-paying wars can help you figure o=
ut what kind of terms you want to institute.</p><p class=3D"">   But there =
are things you can do that go beyond contract terms. For companies that dea=
l with other businesses, having a good relationship, with open lines of com=
munication, can help ease the process. So if you or one of your top employe=
es needs to prod your customer for a payment, the phone call will be a remi=
nder not only of the obligation that needs to be met, but also of the fact =
that there is a good relationship that needs to be preserved.</p><p class=
=3D"">   And, remember, sometimes customers don't pay because they are unha=
ppy with the job. Having good communications can help head off that problem=
, allowing you to hear that something is wrong.</p><p class=3D""> Credit: B=

ass=3D""><p class=3D"">   For several years a Chicago entrepreneur has labo=
red quietly building a company to create an alternative to batteries for po=
wering cell phones and other small gadgets.</p><p class=3D"">   The company=
, Lattice Energy LLC, deliberately kept a low profile because its core tech=
nology, first called cold fusion 18 years ago, has long been ridiculed by m=
ainstream scientists. Lewis Larsen, Lattice's founder, didn't want his ente=
rprise tainted by the empty promises of unlimited cheap energy surrounding =
cold fusion.</p><p class=3D"">   Larsen, who has had careers in investment =
banking and consulting, has worked with many scientists doing experiments w=
ith what now is called low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR) rather than cold=
 fusion. Even with the name change, he said, many scientists mistakenly sti=
ll believe they are creating nuclear fusion in a bottle when they thrust pa=
lladium or other metals into heavy water and add energy.</p><p class=3D""> =
  &quot;A lot of people are doing very good chemistry experiments, but they=
 don't understand what's happening,&quot; Larsen said. &quot;They write fin=
e papers but then add foolish speculation.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   A few =
years ago Larsen began collaborating with a theoretical physicist, professo=
r Allan Widom of Northeastern University in Boston, to help him understand =
why LENR experiments often give off heat and charged particles.</p><p class=
=3D"">   Before taking on the assignment, Widom was a skeptic, but Larsen s=
howed him enough experimental results from laboratories in Russia, China an=
d Japan, as well as the U.S., to convince him that something important was =
happening.</p><p class=3D"">   The problem soon became apparent to Widom: T=
he experimenters were convinced that atoms of a form of hydrogen called deu=
terium were fusing together to form helium.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;That =
kind of fusion requires very high temperatures,&quot; Widom said.</p><p cla=
ss=3D"">   Rather than look for other explanations, most experimenters pref=
erred to invent new laws of physics to account for cold fusion, Widom said.=
 But instead of a strong nuclear force like fusion at work, he concluded th=
at a weak force was at the core of the experimental results. Electrons were=
 combining with protons to form neutrons, giving off energy in the process.=
</p><p class=3D"">   The entrepreneur and the professor have published thei=
r Widom- Larsen theory of low-energy nuclear reactions and have been meetin=
g with business executives and government officials to build credibility fo=
r their ideas.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;Our model invokes no new physics,&=
quot; said Widom. &quot;Everything we've done conforms to the Standard Mode=
l's predictions for weak interactions.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   With advan=
ces in nanotechnology, Larsen predicts it will become practical to design d=
evices using LENR to power cell phones that can last 500 hours. The technol=

 1-800-GOOG-411 and talk to a computer to ask for a business phone number. =
When we tried it, asking for &quot;Chicago Tribune,&quot; it requested a cr=

a's building industry grew more slowly in March as rising interest rates cr=
imped the housing market and a commercial construction boom slowed.</p><p c=
lass=3D"">   The performance of construction index fell 0.6 points from Feb=
ruary to 51.1, according to a report by the Australian Industry Group and H=
ousing Industry Association released in Canberra. A reading above 50 indica=
tes expansion.</p><p class=3D"">   A slowing construction industry, which e=
mploys one in 10 Australian workers, may cool Australia's economic expansio=
n, now in its 16th year. The Reserve Bank of Australia's three interest-rat=
e increases last year have put a brake on housing, countered by a surge in =
engineering work as mining investment soars to meet Asia's appetite for com=
modities.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;While engineering and infrastructure is=
 continuing to expand, house and apartment building remain weak and commerc=
ial building has lost ground in the past month,&quot; Tony Pensabene, assoc=
iate director of economics and research at Australian Industry Group, said =
in a statement.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;A lift in new orders this month p=
oints to an improvement in activity in coming months, although for this to =
be realized interest rates would need to be kept on hold.&quot;</p><p class=
=3D"">   The industry survey asked 100 construction companies about new ord=
ers, employment and input costs.</p><p class=3D"">   An index measuring hom=
e-building activity dropped 0.8 points to 44.4, and apartment-building fell=
 2.4 points to 41.3, the report showed. An index of commercial work slumped=
 16.8 points to 45.</p><p class=3D"">   By contrast, the engineering index =
jumped 8.2 points to 61.7. An index of new orders across the industry rose =
3.4 points to 54.3, a nine-month high.</p><p class=3D"">   Curbing resident=

August and November 2006 took the benchmark rate to a six-year high of 6.25=

p., the world's largest computer-services provider, has created a unit to p=
rocess loans for mortgage companies as they try to cope with waning demand =
and rising defaults.</p><p class=3D"">   Loan applications, underwriting, d=
ocument preparation and closings are among services IBM will provide, said =
a company statement. The unit will use systems from FileNet Corp. and Palis=
ades Technology Partners, two of more than 10 software companies IBM bought=
 last year.</p><p class=3D"">   Mortgage lenders use outsourcing companies =
such as PHH Corp. to avoid the cost of maintaining their own back-office op=
erations, and as buffers against big swings in volume as home sales and ref=
inancings rise and fall. The Washington-based Mortgage Bankers Association =
expects new loans to drop 9 percent to $2.28 trillion this year. More than =
30 lenders closed or sought buyers since the start of 2006.</p><p class=3D"=
">   &quot;Clearly lenders are at some of their highest pain points,&quot; =
said Greg Sullins, the head of the new unit, dubbed IBM Lender Business Pro=
cess Services Inc. &quot;To us, that translates to opportunities.&quot;</p>=
<p class=3D"">   About a quarter of IBM's clients are financial-services co=
mpanies, and their industry is the largest source of revenue for the Armonk=
, N.Y.-based company, Sullins said. The new unit employs 60 people and prob=
ably will add &quot;several hundred&quot; employees in its Charlotte headqu=
arters over the next 12 months, he added.</p><p class=3D"">   IBM spent $1.=
3 billion over the past year for companies whose products will be used by t=
he mortgage service and designing new software and processes, he said. It s=
pent $1.1 billion for Costa Mesa, Calif.-based FileNet, according to data c=
ompiled by Bloomberg. IBM didn't say how much it paid for Englewood Cliffs,=
 N.J.-based Palisades.</p><p class=3D"">   IBM Lender Business Process Serv=
ices is in talks with potential clients showing &quot;strong interest&quot;=
 and expects to have some signed by the third quarter, Sullins said. It and=
 expects to have &quot;predominantly U.S.-based operations,&quot; he said.<=
/p><p class=3D"">   PHH's mortgage clients have included American Express C=
o., Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Charles Schwab Corp.</p><p class=3D"">   Pr=
ivate-equity firm Blackstone Group LP has agreed  to buy PHH's mortgage uni=
t, the largest U.S. mortgage outsourcer, after a $1.8 billion purchase of t=
he parent company by General Electric Co. is completed.</p><p class=3D"">  =

p><div class=3D""><p class=3D"">   In an era of do-it-yourself retirement p=
lanning, workers often are hobbled by a lack of clear information on their =
investments and the fees they are charged to manage them.</p><p class=3D"">=
   Those fees can eat away tens of thousands of dollars over time. Now, fed=
eral regulators are seeking to toughen disclosure rules and devise a single=
 standard for a wide variety of investments and retirement plans.</p><p cla=
ss=3D"">   Saying current disclosures often are &quot;missing the mark by a=
 country mile,&quot; Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christophe=
r Cox said his agency would seek new rules that would force mutual funds, i=
nsurance companies and others to more clearly detail the cost and performan=
ce of investment funds and retirement plans.</p><p class=3D"">   In an inte=
rview, Cox said companies that manage funds and retirement plans should be =
required to report &quot;one simple number that captures fees and expenses.=
&quot; As traditional pensions disappear, more workers are relying on 401(k=
)'s and individual retirement accounts. But excessive fees can jeopardize t=
he financial security of retirees.</p><p class=3D"">   These costs are ofte=
n hidden, either buried in the fine print of a fund prospectus or simply de=
ducted from accounts without ever showing up as a line-item expense.</p><p =
class=3D"">   &quot;It's our top regulatory priority,&quot; said Cox, who w=
ants to make it easier to compare funds. &quot;There are always technical c=
oncerns raised by someone, but the truth is that apples-to-apples compariso=
ns are quite useful for consumers. The same should be possible for our reti=
rement savings.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Mutual funds, for example, provid=
e information about fund fees and trading costs in different parts of the p=
rospectus but don't add them up. Annuities sold by insurance companies, mea=
nwhile, are typically tied to the performance of an underlying mutual fund,=
 but the return of that fund is often not clearly reported, critics say.</p=
><p class=3D"">   Requiring easy-to-read disclosures may be challenging, gi=
ven the complexity of retirement plans.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;It's a go=
od concept: giving people simple, easily comparable information,&quot; said=
 Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation =
of America. &quot;The question is whether they'll come up with a number tha=
t is really meaningful.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   There also is no single r=
egulator. The SEC oversees mutual funds, but it does not regulate retiremen=
t plans offered by insurance companies, banks and other firms that administ=
er retirement plans. To implement new standards that apply across the board=
, Cox would need the support of other agencies.</p><p class=3D"">   The Dep=
artment of Labor, which has broad authority over employer- sponsored retire=
ment plans, including 401(k) plans, has been pursuing its own disclosure in=
itiative and said it supports the broad effort.</p><p class=3D"">   At the =
top levels of the SEC, the view is that far-reaching changes in the pension=
 landscape require the effort. Self-directed retirement plans such as 401(k=
)'s usually are linked to the performance of the financial markets, making =
the decisions of investors, and the bite of fees, crucial.</p><p class=3D""=
>   &quot;If the government expects retirees to manage their own accounts, =
they need to know how their investments are doing, and right now many don't=
 know how they are doing,&quot; SEC Commissioner Roel Campos said.</p><p cl=
ass=3D"">   The initiative will be rolled out in phases. In the coming mont=
hs, the SEC hopes to hold round tables of experts and to publish a concept =
paper outlining the issue, paving the way for a formal rule proposal this y=
ear.</p><p class=3D"">   Some observers maintain that stricter requirements=
 are most needed for plans run by insurers and other companies that are not=
 under the direct scrutiny of the SEC.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;I'm very s=
urprised there hasn't been more focus on these kinds of investment products=
,&quot; said Brent Glading, managing director of Glading Group, a Montclair=
, N.J., firm that analyzes retirement plans for employers.</p><p class=3D""=
>   Lobbyists for the insurance, banking and mutual fund industries all sai=
d they supported clear disclosures for the public.</p><p class=3D"">   At t=
he same time, they said cost was not the only factor that determined the at=
traction of a retirement plan and urged the public to consider other matter=
s as well, such as the choices a plan offered and their suitability to an i=
ndividual's needs.</p><p class=3D"">   For its part, the SEC may propose a =
separate rule aimed at enhancing the disclosures of mutual funds. The idea =
is that improved mutual fund disclosures would make a significant differenc=
e because much of the money in self-directed retirement plans, such as 401(=
k)'s and IRAs, is invested in mutual funds.</p><p class=3D"">   Studies hav=
e shown that many workers are unaware of the fees they pay to run their ret=
irement plans, which can be significant.</p><p class=3D"">   In a report in=
 November, the Government Accountability Office said a retirement nest egg =
of $20,000 might grow to $70,500 after 20 years, presuming annual returns o=
f 7 percent and annual fees of 0.5 percent.</p><p class=3D"">   By contrast=
, that same $20,000 nest egg would grow to only $58,400 if the annual fees =
totaled 1.5 percent, according to the GAO.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;Differ=
ences of even a fraction of a percent can matter enormously over time,&quot=
; Cox said. &quot;Investors deserve to know the after-tax, after-fees perfo=
rmance of their fund and to know whether the manager was good or lucky.&quo=

p><div class=3D""><p class=3D"">   Haven't been there. Haven't done that.</=
p><p class=3D"">   &quot;I had a team in the CBA that finished .500 one sea=
son,&quot; coach Phil Jackson said late Friday night after an eighth loss i=
n 10 games dropped his Los Angeles Lakers to 40-40. &quot;I never missed th=
e playoffs, but that was the toughest year.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   This =
one is moving up the Jackson list quickly. The newest member of the Basketb=
all Hall of Fame and arguably the game's most successful coach agrees the L=
akers probably need to win their final two games just to make the playoffs =
after being 13 games above .500 at midseason.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;I n=
ever envisioned this,&quot; Kobe Bryant acknowledged.</p><p class=3D"">   N=
obody around the Lakers did either, including Jackson, after a revival seas=
on last year and a seven-game, opening-round playoff thriller with the Suns=
. But the Lakers have been crippled with major injuries, and Jackson conced=
es that if the team wasn't trying to avoid a playoff death spiral, Lamar Od=
om and Luke Walton probably wouldn't be playing with the ankle and shoulder=
 injuries that kept them out major parts of the season.</p><p class=3D"">  =
 So the Lakers try to hold it together starting 19-year-old Andrew Bynum, w=
hom they targeted for the D-League before the season, or Ronny Turiaf, retu=
rning after heart surgery, and Smush Parker, essentially the first player i=
n Jackson's 25 years of coaching who has been openly defiant.</p><p class=
=3D"">   Parker has been the &quot;Animal House&quot; kid in the back of th=
e room mumbling under his breath during Jackson talks, derisively saying he=
 gave up trying to read &quot;the man.&quot; After a loss to the Suns last =
week, Parker remarked how much he enjoyed the game because he scored 25 poi=
nts.</p><p class=3D"">   Kwame Brown, who was so important as the Lakers wo=
n 11 of 14 down the stretch last season, seems to be refusing to play. Earl=
ier this season he was accused in what was believed to be the NBA's first f=
ood-fight arrest, when he took a man's cake and threw it at a teammate. Jac=
kson this week pulled a white handkerchief from his breast pocket and waved=
 it when reporters asked about the indifferent Brown, who didn't accompany =
the team.</p><p class=3D"">   In the middle of it all, seething in a famili=
ar scene Jackson has seen before, is Bryant, scoring 50 points in a game la=
st week for the ninth time this season, the most times anyone has done that=
 since Wilt Chamberlain in 1964-65.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;He feels like=
 he has had to score to keep us competitive rather than score to help us wi=
n,&quot; Jackson said.</p><p class=3D"">   Jackson compares it with what he=
 saw from Michael Jordan as a Bulls assistant in 1987 and 1988.</p><p class=
=3D"">   Jordan piled up points and frustrations with a losing team before =
personnel additions sent the Bulls on a path toward their championships.</p=
><p class=3D"">   Jackson has one season left on his contract and has been =
discussing an extension with management, which is something of a family aff=
air in that he still dates the owner's daughter, team executive Jeannie Bus=
s. But Jackson says he wants to determine the direction of the team before =
making a commitment, and he doesn't see the owner needing a $10 million coa=
ch for rebuilding.</p><p class=3D"">   No, Jackson is not taking a pay cut.=
</p><p class=3D"">   But you also can take it to the bank that Bryant isn't=
 on board for any rebuilding.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;He has been angry,&=
quot; Jackson said. &quot;He has been challenging his players after games.&=
quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Jackson saw plenty of that in his early years wit=
h the Bulls. Bryant and Jordan, meanwhile, have developed an interesting bo=
nd over the past year and are often in contact.</p><p class=3D"">   Associa=
tes say it is challenging, as one might expect knowing their similarly comp=
etitive personalities.</p><p class=3D"">   Jordan wonders how Bryant would =
do against the better talent he (Jordan) played against and the rules he pl=
ayed under, including hand-checking that allowed a strong defender like Mit=
ch Richmond to affect his movement.</p><p class=3D"">   Jordan, though, did=
n't have to face the zones Bryant now sees.</p><p class=3D"">   One of my f=
avorite stories involves a pick-and-roll Jordan ran once with Bill Cartwrig=
ht, who was open at the basket.</p><p class=3D"">   Jordan shot.</p><p clas=
s=3D"">   As they went to the sideline after the play, Cartwright asked Jor=
dan why he didn't pass. Jordan replied that one of the double- teaming defe=
nders was Fred Roberts. Translation: I can beat my man and him.</p><p class=
=3D"">   Which is why, when Bryant had that remarkable run of 50-point game=
s last month, most of his scoring came on jumpers.</p><p class=3D"">   The =
loss to the Suns on Friday was an example.</p><p class=3D"">   The Suns usu=
ally double-teamed Bryant on the catch and then dropped another player into=
 a zone. Thus a 93-85 game.</p><p class=3D"">   Not that it ever was easy t=
o average more than 30 points per game, as Jordan did back then, but Jackso=
n's first message to Jordan when he became head coach in 1989 was that shar=
ing the ball leads to championships, not scoring titles.</p><p class=3D""> =
  Jordan was so good he could do both. That's Bryant's challenge.</p><p cla=
ss=3D"">   Bryant is about to win his second straight scoring championship,=
 but it's not getting Jackson and the Lakers anywhere. As Jordan liked to s=
ay way back when, &quot;Pass to who?&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;Kobe i=
s like Michael,&quot; Jackson said. &quot;He can't take the losing. I've en=
joyed coaching this team. I worry for them. They are good guys and they hav=
e a good time. We've had some disheartening losses. I think they're getting=
 used to it. That's what bothers me.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   ----------</=

 nuclear talks said Saturday that a 2-month-old disarmament plan lacks &quo=
t;momentum&quot; as North Korea failed to meet a deadline for shutting down=
 its main nuclear reactor and processing facility.</p><p class=3D"">   &quo=
t;We don't have a lot of momentum right now,&quot; U.S. Assistant Secretary=
 of State Christopher Hill told reporters in Beijing before meeting his Chi=
nese counterpart, Wu Dawei.</p><p class=3D"">   The disarmament plan, reach=
ed in February after nearly four years of arduous negotiations, laid out a =
timetable for North Korea to dismantle its nuclear programs. The plan was u=
nexpectedly disrupted by a dispute over frozen North Korean funds in a Maca=
u bank that Washington said  last week was finally resolved.</p><p class=3D=
"">   On Friday, Hill did not say what the consequences would be if the Nor=
th missed the Saturday deadline.</p><p class=3D"">   As part of the disarma=
ment agreement, the North was supposed to gain access to $25 million in fro=
zen funds at the Banco Delta Asia bank in the Chinese territory of Macau.  =
Washington blacklisted the bank in September 2005 for allegedly helping the=
 North launder money and pass counterfeit $100 bills.</p><p class=3D"">   T=
he funds were unblocked last  week, but North Korea's Foreign Ministry said=
 Friday that it was still confirming the release. The ministry said the cou=
ntry would carry out its side of the February agreement &quot;when the lift=
ing of the sanction is proved to be a reality.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   --=

p><div class=3D""><p class=3D"">   Construction growth in London and the so=
utheast of England reached the fastest pace in at least 12 years during the=
 first quarter, leading a pickup in the U.K. building industry, a survey sh=
owed.</p><p class=3D"">   The number of London land surveyors reporting con=
struction workloads rose outnumbered those showing declines by 36 percentag=
e points, the most since the survey began in 1994, the Royal Institution of=
 Chartered Surveyors said. In the U.K., the net balance was 28 percentage p=
oints, the highest since the second quarter of 2004.</p><p class=3D"">   Br=
itain's building industry, which accounts for 6 percent of the economy, exp=
anded the most in three quarters in the final three months of 2006.</p><p c=
lass=3D"">   A shortage of places to live and work in London is spurring a =
rash of construction, including the city's first 1,000-foot skyscraper.</p>=
<p class=3D"">   &quot;Private commercial building in London is at an all-t=
ime high, that's what's driven workloads up,&quot; said David Stubbs, senio=
r economist at the surveyors agency. &quot;In the U.K., we had a decent pic=
kup in 2006 and it's going to be an even better 2007.&quot;</p><p class=3D"=
">   London's financial district is attracting investors in commercial buil=
dings amid a rise in rents.</p><p class=3D"">   London Mayor Ken Livingston=
e is encouraging more skyscrapers in the city, where the highest building i=
s the 800-foot-tall Canary Wharf Tower, to make better use of limited space=
. The biggest yet will be the 1,016-foot Shard of Glass, which was designed=
 by Renzo Piano and will stand on the South Bank of the Thames by London Br=
idge.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;On the commercial side, retail is slightly =
weak, industrial is OK, and the offices market is doing the best,&quot; Stu=
bbs said. &quot;There's still tremendous pent-up demand in the housing mark=
et too.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   House prices rose 6.7 percent in March fr=
om a year earlier, the most in almost four years, property research company=
 Hometrack Ltd. said March 26. London and the southeast of England led gain=
s, outpacing Wales and the North of England, where values were unchanged.</=

ary, when colder-than-normal temperatures crimped construction, Canada Mort=
gage and Housing Corp. said.</p><p class=3D"">   New-home construction, whi=
ch has been a major contributor to the country's economic growth, will decl=
ine this year because of higher prices for homes and rising mortgage costs,=
 the Ottawa-based CMHC and the Bank of Canada have said. Starts will finish=
 the year at 209,500 units, down from 227,395 in 2006, the housing agency p=
redicted last month.</p><p class=3D"">   Even as building increased in Marc=
h, &quot;housing starts are gradually trending lower,&quot; Bob Dugan, the =
agency's chief economist, said in a statement. &quot;This downward trend is=
 consistent with our view that housing starts in 2007 will be lower than in=
 2006.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Building expanded 7.3 percent last year, m=
aking construction the fastest-growing industry in the country.</p><p class=
=3D"">   Starts in Canadian cities rose 9.1 percent to 177,900 units during=
 March, led by multiple-family units such as condominiums. The prairie prov=
inces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba led the gain, with a combined 2=
6 percent increase to 49,200 units.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;Although Cana=
da's housing market remains on solid footing, we expect to see starts decli=
ne to about 200,000 by the end of the year, as the housing market cools fro=
m its unsustainably hot pace of the last few years,&quot; Jacqui Douglas, a=

=3D"">   Tal Dor, an Israeli Jew, Huda Abu Arqoub, a Palestinian Muslim, an=
d Amal Nassar, a Palestinian Christian, are peace activists on tour in the =
Midwest to speak about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. With sponsorship f=
rom Washington, D.C.-based Partners for  Peace, the three advocate an end t=
o Israel's military occupation and the creation of a Palestinian state in t=
he West Bank and Gaza. The Tribune spoke to them about their efforts toward=
 peace in the Mideast.  An edited transcript follows:</p><p class=3D"">   W=
hat motivated you to participate in the tour?</p><p class=3D"">   Dor: I se=
e the U.S. playing a very important role in the power dynamic back home, in=
fluencing and encouraging the occupation. What I'm trying to do is to say t=
o [the American] people: Start asking questions. You have a responsibility =
for the Israeli occupation and you need to start acknowledging it, and star=
t acting to change it.</p><p class=3D"">   Nassar: I'm here to raise awaren=
ess of what is happening in Palestine. I see more confiscating of [Palestin=
ian] land, expanding of [Israeli] settlements [in the West Bank], building =
a wall which [strangles] the Palestinians economically and socially. What w=
e are trying to do is stand against the situation and not to give up.</p><p=
 class=3D"">   What are the most common questions you get from audiences?</=
p><p class=3D"">   Dor: As a Jewish Israeli from South Africa, the most com=
mon question I get is what do I think of [Jimmy] Carter's book [&quot;Pales=
tine: Peace Not Apartheid&quot;].  Most people are commenting because of th=
e title. It created a lot of anger in Israel and among Jews around the worl=
d. [They] do not like to make the comparison. It is something that makes us=
 feel bad. I say of course it's not the same; the narrative is not the same=
.  ...  [But] you can say the roads going to the [Jewish] settlements are a=
partheid. You can see the difference in colors of [Palestinian] identity ca=
rds, like the different colors that were given to black South Africans. The=
se colors define your freedom of movement. This is something we don't like =
to look at. We have to look at it.</p><p class=3D"">   Do you think America=
ns have an accurate picture of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinia=
ns?</p><p class=3D"">   Abu Arqoub: I know for sure they do not have a clue=
. They miss the daily suffering of the Palestinians. They are not familiar =
with the power dynamics. The American people think there is a conflict betw=
een two equals. They don't know it's not true.</p><p class=3D"">   Dor: I t=
hink Americans have the same idea I got growing up in Israel. For example, =
one of the things said to us is &quot;Palestinian terrorist&quot; and &quot=
;Israeli Defense Force.&quot; We use these terms all the time, of course. B=
ut you'd think at least the international [community] would say &quot;Wait,=
 who has more weapons?&quot; So it amazes me that one is considered terrori=
st and one is considered defense.</p><p class=3D"">   The international com=
munity maintains that Hamas has not explicitly recognized Israel or agreed =
to accept previous peace agreements. Both Israel and America consider it a =
terrorist organization. Why should Israel negotiate with a government that =
includes Hamas?</p><p class=3D"">   Abu Arqoub: First of all, Hamas recogni=
zed Israel and wanted to negotiate, but the door was slammed in their face.=
 They offered a truce more than once. [Think of] Hamas like the Sinn Fein. =
Internally, Hamas is going through the same process as Sinn Fein. But nobod=
y is sponsoring the change. The international community is saying, &quot;No=
, you are a terrorist organization.&quot; It's damaging to their internal e=
fforts to evolve into a political party. They are not being given the chanc=
e.</p><p class=3D"">   Dor: I think that this whole discourse of Hamas not =
recognizing Israel is a bit ironic when Israel is not recognizing the Pales=
tinians. They don't recognize them as a nation, as a people.</p><p class=3D=
"">   Some of the brightest minds in the diplomatic world have been searchi=
ng for a formula to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for years. Why i=
s it so difficult to reach an agreement that both sides can accept?</p><p c=
lass=3D"">   Abu Arqoub: I think the problem is in the definition of a viab=
le [Palestinian] state. What do we mean by a viable state? [Will] the [bord=
er crossings] be in the hands of [the Israelis]? What about the question of=
 settlements? If every time the Israeli army feels they need to get inside =
the West Bank because of the settlements, then I have no country. I have no=
 state.</p><p class=3D"">   Dor: I want to rephrase the question. This word=
 peace negotiation is an illusion. You cannot speak about peace when there =
is occupation. Four weeks ago [Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas] and [Is=
raeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert] met, shaking hands on television. It was =
very -- wow -- amazing meeting. At the same time, for that whole week, the =
Israeli army invaded the [Palestinian] city of Nablus.</p><p class=3D"">   =
Nassar: Israel mixes religion [into the conflict]. We have to go every now =
and then to a [military] court in Ramallah [on the West Bank]. [Editor's no=
te: The Nassar family is fighting confiscation of its land near Bethlehem.]=
 In one of the court sessions, the judge asked about our documents and maps=
. We had everything from 1924. Then the other side said, &quot;We have a pa=
per from God.&quot; They stood up with a small piece of paper and said, &qu=
ot;We have it from God.&quot;</p><p class=3D"">   Do Israelis and Palestini=
ans have the same definition of a Palestinian state?</p><p class=3D"">   Ab=
u Arqoub: I don't think they have the same definition. To the Palestinian, =
a state is viable. It has sovereignty. It has borders. It has access to the=
 outside world. It has structure, geographical continuity. To the Israelis,=
 a [Palestinian] state is one that they can enter into every time they feel=
 their security is threatened.</p><p class=3D"">   Dor: I believe if Israel=
 really wanted a Palestinian state, it would have happened already. But eve=
rything is going on not to let it happen. I think this talk about two state=
s is again a manipulative discourse.</p><p class=3D"">   What about the Isr=
aelis who say that if they relinquish the West Bank the Palestinians will u=
se it as a launching pad to liberate the rest of historic Palestine, which =
is now Israel?</p><p class=3D"">   Dor: I would say, &quot;I am not afraid.=
&quot; I would say, &quot;Go speak to Palestinians.&quot; Most Palestinians=
 don't speak about throwing the Jews into the sea. We must not do to the Pa=
lestinians what we are assuming maybe they will do to us. We have to acknow=
ledge that most of the Palestinians want to live in peace.</p><p class=3D""=
>   Isn't part of the problem that Palestinian refugees insist on returning=
 to land that is now in Israel?</p><p class=3D"">   Dor: I'm not sure all t=
he refugees will want to come back anyway. But we have to discuss how they =
can come back. We have to talk about justice.</p><p class=3D"">   Abu Arqou=
b: They can go to the West Bank when the West Bank is a viable state.</p><p=
 class=3D"">   There has been a lot of criticism of the barrier that separa=
tes Israel from the West Bank. But suicide bombings have gone down since it=
 was built. Do you think the wall makes Israel more secure?</p><p class=3D"=
">   Abu Arqoub: [Fewer bombs are] not because of the wall. It's because th=
e militant groups decided to play politics. I've managed to get into Jerusa=
lem [by circumventing Israeli checkpoints]. I could have had a bomb on me. =
That's why I believe the sense of security in Israel is twisted. It has not=
hing to do with [the wall]. If Hamas and Islamic Jihad have the intention o=
f doing a suicide bombing in Israel, they will do it. The wall is not going=
 to stop them.</p><p class=3D"">   Dor: I disagree. I think the wall did re=
duce the amount of suicide bombings. [It] is reducing the bombing but it's =
increasing the hatred. When you close people in ghettos, when people have n=
othing to lose, they will find ways to resist. I believe it will get worse =
because of the wall. Israel is creating a more dangerous place.</p><p class=

on time for my wife, Georgina, and me. Four short-term certificates of depo=
sit totaling 10 percent of our fixed- income portfolio will come due during=
 the next four months.</p><p class=3D"">   The fact that we have CDs has su=
rprised some readers who expect a financial columnist to seek investments w=
ith the potential for higher returns. And Georgina and I do, with a signifi=
cant chunk of our portfolio in low-cost, broadly diversified stock mutual f=
unds.</p><p class=3D"">   But we also diversify with fixed-income investmen=
ts and are pleased with how our short-term CDs, all for 13 months or less a=
nd yielding between 5.2 percent and 5.8 percent a year, have stabilized our=
 portfolio while providing dependable income.</p><p class=3D"">   We plan t=
o replace the maturing CDs with longer-term fixed- income investments, eith=
er other CDs and/or investment-grade bonds with staggered maturities from 2=
013 through 2017.</p><p class=3D"">   We already own fixed-income investmen=
ts coming due every year from 2008 through 2012.</p><p class=3D"">   While =
our strategy is not for everyone, the subject is timely given the subprime =
mortgage problems roiling the credit markets, the mixed signals about the e=
conomy and the billions of dollars coming due in short-term CDs. For most o=
f us, the basic reason for fixed- income investments is not to chase yields=
 or speculate on the direction of interest rates but to smooth out the vola=
tility of a portfolio and/or create a stable and dependable source of cash =
flow.</p><p class=3D"">   For that latter purpose, it's hard to beat &quot;=
laddering,&quot; the strategy of investing in an assortment of bonds (Bank =
CDs are just one form of bonds.) with different maturities.</p><p class=3D"=
">   With laddering, if interest rates fall, bonds that mature soon will ha=
ve to be reinvested at a lower rate. But the other bonds in the portfolio w=
ould continue to pay above-market rates. If interest rates rise, the total =
portfolio might pay a below-market return, but the maturing bonds can be re=
invested at higher rates.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;The point is to create =
a stable source of cash you can always rely on,&quot; said John Radtke, exe=
cutive director of Incapital LLC, an underwriter and distributor of fixed-i=
ncome securities based in Chicago and Ft. Lauderdale.</p><p class=3D"">   I=
n addition, &quot;having a small amount in cash or short-term CDs is probab=
ly not a bad idea&quot; now, Radtke said, considering their yields approach=
, match or sometimes even exceed those of longer-term high- quality bonds. =
With close to $100 billion in short-term CDs coming due this year in the Un=
ited States, many banks are offering special rates on short-term certificat=
es to entice customers to renew.</p><p class=3D"">   If all your money is i=
n short-term deposits, however, you run the risk that interest rates will d=
rop by the time they mature.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;If concerns about th=
e housing industry persist, the likelihood of the Fed cutting rates is sign=
ificant,&quot; Radtke said, a move that would lead banks to lower the inter=
est rate on CDs.</p><p class=3D"">   To counter that risk, Radtke suggests =
rounding off your fixed- income portfolio with intermediate- and longer-ter=
m bonds that are rated investment grade. The latter point is significant. I=
f capital preservation and reliable income are your goals, you want to stay=
 away from riskier high-yield or &quot;junk&quot; bonds, even if they tempt=

=3D"">   Seeking to become the greenest city in the country, Cambridge, Mas=
s., will launch a sweeping $70 million energy efficiency program to conserv=
e energy in virtually every building within city boundaries, reducing emiss=
ions that contribute to global warming.</p><p class=3D"">   University, com=
mercial, and even residential buildings will receive energy audits over the=
 next five years to pinpoint energy inefficiencies. Property owners will th=
en be offered low- or zero- interest loans to undertake remediation efforts=
 ranging from replacing incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescents =
to installing insulated roofs and more efficient heating and cooling system=
s.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;The notion of a city as a platform on which to=
 build massive energy efficiency is the critical innovation,&quot; said Dou=
glas I. Foy, former Massachusetts secretary of commonwealth development, wh=
o is advising Cambridge officials. &quot;Cities are the Saudi Arabia of ene=
rgy efficiency, a mine of massive efficiency opportunities.&quot;</p><p cla=
ss=3D"">   The energy efficiency measures will be financed by loans made fr=
om a $70 million fund, most of which will be raised from private sources by=
 investment bank Bostonia Partners LLC. Large capital improvement costs may=
 be shared by the program and the building owners.</p><p class=3D"">   Camb=
ridge officials expect that as the city demonstrates progress on reducing e=
lectricity use, they can qualify to receive money from a $1 billion-a-year =
fund that the operator of the regional electric power grid collects from us=
ers to ensure there are sufficient power supplies in the future.</p><p clas=
s=3D"">   The Cambridge organizers said the first phase of their efforts wi=
ll take five to seven years and will target about half of the 23,000 buildi=
ngs in the city. The goal in that period is to reduce overall electricity u=
se by 10 percent, and during peak hours -- roughly 4 to 7 p.m. daily -- by =
14 percent. The average household in Cambridge uses about 4,500 kilowatt ho=
urs of electricity a year, costing about $800, according to city officials.=
</p><p class=3D"">   The energy specialists who helped organize the effort =
believe that by reducing consumption within buildings they will also be red=
ucing the emissions that contribute to global warming. If Cambridge meets i=
ts goals, the energy specialists said, it will have reduced annual emission=
s of carbon dioxide by 150,000 tons.</p><p class=3D"">   &quot;Seventy perc=
ent of emissions come from buildings,&quot; said Robert L. Pratt, senior vi=
ce president of the Henry P. Kendall Foundation, which focuses on environme=
ntal matters. It conceived and helped to design and pay for the program.</p=
><p class=3D"">   Most of Cambridge's buildings are residential, with aroun=
d 2,400 others owned by universities and other nonprofits, commercial and i=
ndustrial landlords, and governments.</p><p class=3D"">   Cambridge officia=
ls expect the greatest and quickest savings will come from working with uni=
versities and large commercial and industrial properties, which collectivel=
y account for 69 percent of the city's energy consumption. Ultimately, prop=
onents hope that all residential property owners will agree to undertake th=
e recommended improvements.</p><p class=3D"">   Participation is voluntary,=
 but a significant element of the project is a campaign to build public ent=
husiasm, to create peer pressure to get more property owners involved.</p><=
p class=3D"">   The nonprofit organization, the Cambridge Energy Alliance, =
will hire energy consultants to work with property owners to determine how =
to make their buildings more efficient. Improvements could be as simple as =
beefing up insulation or adding storm windows, or something as expensive as=
 installing a high-efficiency cogeneration system at a large property, whic=
h generates electricity and throws off heat to warm rooms in winter.</p><p =
class=3D"">   The nonprofit will administer the program, issue loans, and t=
rack and certify reductions in energy use. Although many financing details =
have yet to be worked out, building owners are supposed to repay the loans =
using the savings from reduced energy costs.</p><p class=3D"">   For exampl=
e, proponents said a typical homeowner who gets a $1,100 loan to add insula=
tion and buy a more efficient air- conditioner could reduce annual energy b=
ills by around $250, meaning the payoff period can be four to five years.</=
p><p class=3D"">   Initially, property owners will be allowed to pocket abo=
ut one- third of the energy savings from these measures, the consultants sa=
id, using the balance to repay their loans. Once the loans are fully repaid=
, the property owner would reap all future savings.</p><p class=3D"">   Cam=
bridge officials and consultants are trying to work out an arrangement with=
 electricity provider NStar, a partner in the program, to allow electricity=
 users to repay the loans through a charge on their regular monthly bills.<=
/p><p class=3D"">   &quot;This is an excellent project and could become the=
 energy model of the future,&quot; said Tom May, NStar's chief executive.</=
p><p class=3D"">   Art Rosenfeld, a physicist and member of the California =
Energy Commission who was one of the nation's first experts on saving energ=
y, said the comprehensive nature of the Cambridge project exceeds most init=
iatives under way in California, considered a leader in such programs. &quo=
t;You're ahead of us,&quot; he said.</p><p class=3D"">   Such large-scale m=
unicipal energy efficiency efforts are spreading. Foy said he is working wi=
th New York City officials to design a program similar to Cambridge's. And =
state officials are starting a $2 million fund this year to begin energy ef=
ficiency programs in Boston and four other Massachusetts cities that have n=
ot yet been selected.</p><p class=3D""> Credit: By Thomas C Palmer Jr, The =

ortgage payments, lenders across the country are seeking creative ways to k=
eep delinquent customers out of foreclosure.</p><p class=3D"">   One of the=
 newest approaches: the &quot;Mod Squad,&quot; a roving 50- member team of =
problem-solvers who work for Texas-based EMC Mortgage, a subsidiary of Wall=
 Street investment bank Bear Stearns. EMC services approximately 500,000 lo=
ans nationwide, with $78 billion in outstanding balances.</p><p class=3D"">=
   Named for a hit TV series from the late 1960s and early '70s, the Mod Sq=
uad consists of experts in loan modifications -- custom workout solutions f=
or borrowers who no longer can afford their mortgages. The object is to sea=
rch for changes in rates and terms that will permit the borrowers to remain=
 in their houses, pay down their loans and avoid foreclosure.</p><p class=
=3D"">   &quot;Foreclosing doesn't benefit anyone -- not the borrower, not =
the lender, not the bond holder,&quot; EMC President and CEO John Vella sai=
d in an interview. On the other hand, recasting certain terms of the mortga=
ge -- lowering monthly payments for a period, deferring unpaid principal an=
d interest or changing the rate -- may allow delinquent borrowers to get pa=
st whatever financial issues caused them to fall behind.</p><p class=3D""> =
  What's unusual about the Mod Squad is that rather than waiting for homeow=
ners to contact EMC when they get in a jam, the team reaches out to individ=
ual borrowers, working with local consumer and credit counseling organizati=
ons and holding loan modification educational meetings for borrowers in cit=
ies where delinquencies are rising.</p><p class=3D"">   Loan modification i=
s  just one approach mortgage servicers can use to stem the tide of foreclo=
sures. Other techniques include:</p><p class=3D"">   *Repayment plans where=
  balances are reduced over time through small, regular add-ons to borrower=
s' monthly payments.</p><p class=3D"">   *Forbearance agreements whereby pr=
incipal and interest payments are reduced or suspended for a time, enabling=
 the borrowers to get their finances under control. Then the regular paymen=
ts resume, along with gradual reimbursements of balances in arrears.</p><p =
class=3D"">   Remedies such as these are more common than many credit-strap=
ped homeowners may be aware. In fact, major mortgage institutions such as F=
reddie Mac, Fannie Mae and the Federal Housing Administration require loan =
servicing companies to offer one or more plans to delinquent customers who =
have a reasonable chance of avoiding foreclosure.</p><p class=3D"">   FHA e=
ven allows money to be advanced interest-free on behalf of delinquent homeo=
wners to bring their loans current, up to a maximum of 12 months worth of p=
rincipal, interest, taxes and insurance. The mortgage company files a &quot=
;partial claim&quot; with FHA to obtain the funds needed to pay all arrears=
. The borrowers are expected to repay everything they owe at the end of the=
 loan term or from the proceeds when they sell their home.</p><p class=3D""=
>   Variations on that may be the next development  in foreclosure- prevent=
ion.</p><p class=3D"">   Many buyers in the last several years made no down=
 payments and bought costlier properties than they could afford. Some now f=
ace massive monthly payment boosts and negative equity situations.</p><p cl=
ass=3D"">   They can't afford their mortgages, nor can they afford to refin=
ance because they owe more than their house is worth.</p><p class=3D"">   L=
eaders in the House and Senate have urged private lenders, Wall Street, Fan=
nie, Freddie and the federal government to devise programs to help thousand=
s of boom-era buyers who face foreclosure this year or next.</p><p class=3D=
"">   One option that is gaining significant attention has been advanced by=
 a Virginia-based loss-mitigation firm, Lyons McCloskey LLC. Borrowers in s=
erious default would be refinanced into government-insured or guaranteed fi=
xed-rate programs such as FHA, VA or rural housing. If their loan balances =
exceeded FHA statutory limits, the refinancings could be provided through F=
annie Mae or Freddie Mac.</p><p class=3D"">   Initial balances on the new m=
ortgages would be what the borrowers could afford based on their current in=
comes at market rates. Any shortfall between the amount of the new loan and=
 the balances owed on the previous loan would be recast into a &quot;soft&q=
uot; second lien, a second mortgage or deed of trust carrying a minimal or =
zero interest rate and no monthly payments.</p><p class=3D"">   The second =
lien would be due in a lump sum at any  sale of the property or whenever th=
e borrowers could afford to retire the debt.</p><p class=3D"">   Credit ris=
ks on the soft second mortgage would be shared by Wall Street bond investor=
s, the federal government or other mortgage market players.</p><p class=3D"=
">   The concept wouldn't keep everybody out of foreclosure, nor would it b=
e extended to people who inflated their incomes or recklessly bought proper=
ties they could not afford.</p><p class=3D"">   But it could be one answer =
for payment-shocked subprime borrowers who simply got in over their heads a=
nd mistimed the end of the boom.</p><p class=3D"">   ----------</p><p class=
